<h3>THE PONY EXPRESS RIDER</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>F</span>ar</span> as the eye could see lay a rough and broken
desert of sage. It stretched to the edge of a
flat and arid world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In front of the long one-story adobe station a man
waited, eyes turned to the west. His hand rested
on the flat straight back of a spirited chestnut horse.
Byers was small and wiry, hard as nails. His high-heeled
boots, buckskin breeches, flannel shirt, and
skull cap had all been chosen for utility and not for
looks. He wasted no energy in useless protest,
but the fat station keeper who leaned against the
door jamb and chewed tobacco knew he was seething
with impatience. The wrangler holding a second
saddled horse knew it, too. For the pony express
rider from Carson was late and his delay was keeping
Byers from starting on the next lap of the transcontinental
journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fat man sang lugubriously and tunelessly in a
voice that had been created solely for his own amusement.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Old Grimes is dead, that good old man,</p>
<p class='line0'>We ne’er shall see him more.</p>
<p class='line0'>He wore a single-breasted coat,</p>
<p class='line0'>All buttoned down before.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The wrangler looked at him reproachfully and
murmured, “Durned if he wouldn’t sing at a wake
and spoil everybody’s enjoyment.”</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“His heart was open as the day,</p>
<p class='line0'>His feelin’s all were true.</p>
<p class='line0'>His hair it was inclined to gray,</p>
<p class='line0'>He wore it in a queue,”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>intoned the vocalist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not news,” the wrangler told himself bitterly.
“I done heard all them interestin’ details two hundred
and seventy-three times.” Aloud, he attempted
a diversion. “Len’ me a loan of a chew of tobacco,
Jim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The station keeper dived into his left hip pocket,
produced a ragged plug, and offered it to his helper.
Meanwhile he gave further information about the
wearing apparel and physical idiosyncrasies of one
Grimes, defunct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonder what’s holdin’ Tim,” the stableman interposed
at the end of another stanza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He ain’t been late before in a blue moon. I
don’t recollect as he ever was late,” answered the
fat man, drawn momentarily from his rhymed
epitaph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byers said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The habit of the hard-riding pony express messengers
of Russell, Majors, and Waddell was to be ahead
of schedule. Each man prided himself on covering
his relay under the assigned number of hours. The
mounts supplied were chosen for speed, stamina,
and heart; the men for gameness, resource, and
knowledge of the country. To be late was contrary
to the tradition of the service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pony express was a triumph of American
pluck and energy. It stretched from St. Joseph
to San Francisco, two thousand miles through the
heart of the Indian country. The enterprise included
five hundred superb horses, nearly two
hundred stations, a hundred riders. The men in
the little racing saddles were stripped to the last
ounce. For protection they carried only a knife
and a revolver. The mail bags never weighed more
than twenty pounds. Each letter was written
on thin tissue paper. The postage on the smallest
was five dollars. Between the Missouri and Sacramento
the time-table called for ten days, but often
the pouches moved two hundred miles toward their
destination in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those in the saddle had to be man size in soul.
No weaklings ever applied for this job. Some of
those in the service were outlaws, for court warrants
did not reach into the sage. Many were desperadoes.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a>
But few of them were quitters. They played out
the hand that had been dealt them.</p>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<div class='footnote'>
<p class='footnote'>
<span class='footnote-id' id='f1'><a href='#r1'>[1]</a></span>

This was more true of the station keepers and the attendants than
of the stage drivers and pony express messengers. Slade, the notorious
man killer, was superintendent of a division at Julesburg, Colorado. He
succeeded Jules, whom he murdered in cold blood. Slade ruled his
crew of wild assistants with an iron fist. He was an able and efficient
servant of the company. Later he was hanged by the vigilantes in
Montana. Legends of the country, probably much exaggerated, credit
him with having killed thirty men.—W. M. R.</p>

</div>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Tim’s sure late,” the wrangler said hurriedly,
for he saw signs of a return to music which did not
soothe his savage breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kid McClintock’s early. Hour ahead of his
schedule,” the station keeper replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far away to the east a small cloud of dust rose
from the sage and greasewood. Almost at the same
time a second billow of yellow alkali appeared in the
sunset glow of the opposite horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fat man grumbled. “Hell’s hinges! That
accident to Meighan is liable to shoot the whole
schedule up. Tim’ll have to double back to Carson
in his place. I’ll have him dig us up another man
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rider from the east arrived at the station first.
He pulled up beside the wrangler, leaped to the
ground, and at the same time reached for the tie
straps which fastened the flat leather mail pouches
to the saddle. Two minutes was allowed for the
change of sacks from one horse to another, but
usually the transfer was made in ten seconds. The
messenger, a long lean boy, swept the pouches deftly
from one saddle to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Meighan?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Done bust his laig tryin’ to gentle that sorrel
mustang. Tim Keefe will have to take his run to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Tim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in yet. There’s his dust.” The station
keeper waved a fat hand toward the sunset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byers had been watching intently the dust cloud
moving through the brush. “Something’s wrong,”
he said briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh McClintock looked. The approaching horse
was off the trail. Its gait was peculiar. Plunging
unsteadily in spurts, it was weaving from side to side.
Instead of a rider, a sack seemed to be prone in the
saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock ran forward and caught the bridle of
the unsteady horse. The flank of the animal was
clotted with a splash of dust and blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sack slid from the saddle as the horse shied.
The sack was a man who had been clinging feebly to
the mane of the bay. He groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Piutes—this side the Silver Mountains,” he
whispered, and fainted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The station manager, the wrangler, and McClintock
gave him first aid. An arrow head, deeply imbedded,
projected from the flesh back of the shoulder.
One of the rider’s boots was filled with blood, due to a
bullet which had shattered the ankle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byers spent no time in helping with the wounded
man. He had other business. If the Indians got a
messenger, that was in the day’s work. The mails
had to go through without delay. He transferred
the pouches to his own saddle, swung on, and galloped
into the desert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kid McClintock rose. He, too, must be on his
way, for there was nobody else to carry the mail to
Carson City.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be movin’,” he said briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks like you’re elected,” agreed the fat man,
following the boy to a water olla where the young
fellow washed his baked throat, drank deeply, and
filled his canteen. “Not much use wishin’ advice
on you. It’s a gamble, o’ course. Injuns may be
anywhere. But I reckon maybe you better swing to
the south and hit the Walker River range. They’re
liable to be watchin’ the trail for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy moved to the fresh horse, spurs dragging
and jingling. He had done his day’s work. The
horse upon which he had ridden in, lathered with
sweat and still breathing deep from a long fast run,
was mute testimony of this. The dry powdery
dust of the desert covered every inch of the young
rider. His legs were stiff and his shoulders tired.
But the spring of splendid youth trod in his stride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had before him more than another hundred
miles of travel, through a country infested by hostile
savages. He might get through alive or he might
not. That was on the knees of the gods. He had to
take what came. More than once he had run a
gauntlet of redskins. He had been a target for their
arrows and their slugs. Tim was not the first messenger
he had seen bring in on his person souvenirs
of their missiles. The one salient point was that the
mail had to go through. It always had reached its
destination—always but once. On that occasion
the messenger offered the only acceptable excuse for
his failure. He lay dead on the trail, his scalp gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock shot westward in a cloud of dust.
Half a mile from the station he swung sharply to the
south.</p>

<h3>“HURRAH FOR WASHOE!”</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>P</span>lacerville</span> was busy as a hive of bees on
a warm June afternoon. Its hotels and restaurants
were crowded to capacity. The saloons
were doing a rush business and the gambling
halls teemed with a packed and jostling humanity.
Grocery stores bustled with the activity of clerks
filling orders, packing supplies, nailing up boxes, and
sewing bales. The main streets were filled with
mixed crowds of miners, speculators, gamblers, men
of leisure then known as “bummers,” and such flotsam
as is always washed up in the stampede for a new
mining camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vaqueros drove loaded mules and burros through
the streets with soft liquid oaths of command. A
sixteen-horse ore wagon, painted red, the bed of it
six feet deep, rumbled down the road with two
“back-actions” behind, each of these also filled with
ore. They had come straight from the diggings at
Virginia City. Freight outfits were loading at stores
and wholesale liquor houses with supplies for the
new camp. Men bought and sold hurriedly. A
hundred outfits were being roped up to cross the
Sierras to the Carson Valley. Ox teams swung
into town and out again with goods for the new
district. Everywhere was that orderly confusion of
many cross currents of humanity moving to a
common end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That common end was Washoe.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> The name was
on every tongue. It dominated every mind. All
the able-bodied old prospectors who had come round
the Horn in the old days, who had followed the stampedes
to Kern River, the Fraser, and Told Bluff, were
now headed as by one impulse for the silver diggings
at the foot of Mt. Davidson. Such rich grounds
never had been seen before. All one had to do was
to pan the outcroppings and grow rich in a few weeks.
Hurrah for Washoe! Hip hip for the land of golden
dreams! Washoe or bust!</p>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<div class='footnote'>
<p class='footnote'>
<span class='footnote-id' id='f2'><a href='#r2'>[2]</a></span>

Nevada was commonly known as Washoe until its admission as a
territory under the Spanish name.—W. M. R.</p>

</div>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>A canvas-covered emigrant wagon drawn by a pair
of emaciated horses moved slowly toward the hills.
The driver was a bullet-headed young fellow with
sullen, close-set eyes. These were a peculiar grayish-yellow,
and the pupils were very small. He was unshaven,
poorly dressed, and far from clean. The
hardship of a long overland trip had undermined his
self-respect and worn away the thin veneer of the
man’s civility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the crest of the first rise he turned in his seat
and looked back toward the town. “Good-bye,
Hangtown,”<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> he shouted with an oath, shaking his
ragged whip.</p>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<div class='footnote'>
<p class='footnote'>
<span class='footnote-id' id='f3'><a href='#r3'>[3]</a></span>

In the early days Placerville was often called Hangtown.</p>

</div>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>The skeleton horses crept up the road toward the
mountains. Presently evidence of the stampede to
Washoe began to manifest itself. The prairie
schooner passed a broken-down stage, a smashed
wheel, a splintered wagon tongue snapped in the
middle. An empty whisky barrel advertised one
of the chief staples of trade. A dead burro lay half
buried in the mire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road had been a good one once. Perhaps it
would be hard and firm again after the slush from the
rains had dried. Just now it was one to try the
patience of man and beast. There were stretches
where even the pack mules bogged down while
Mexican drivers beat and hauled at them to an
accompaniment of excited curses in their native
tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stage from Virginia City swung down the grade,
“Pony” King on the box holding the lines, his long
whip crackling out snakelike toward the leaders.
The stage was not a handsome Concord, the pride of
every employee of the company, but one of the mud-wagons
used as a substitute when the roads were bad.
A pack train of fifteen animals overtook the covered
wagon. These carried nothing but liquors—whisky,
gin, lager beer, brandy, some pipes of California
wine, and a few baskets of champagne. Foot travellers,
carrying outfits on their backs, ploughed
wearily forward. Nothing but the wonders of the
Comstock Lode could have kept their tired legs moving
through the mud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At every gulch there was a bar, the fixtures improvised
from a couple of dry-goods boxes and a canvas
top. Restaurants announced themselves every
few miles, as well as hotels, which had all necessary
accommodations for tired stampeders except food,
beds, and bedding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later in the day the prairie schooner came into a
region where patches of snow began to appear in the
hill crotches above. The grade was stiffer and the
poor horses made sorry progress. A dozen times
they gave up, exhausted. The driver beat them furiously
with his whip and flung raucous curses at
them. From the wagon a big-eyed child and a wan-faced
woman dismounted to lighten the load. Once
the woman timidly murmured a protest at her husband’s
brutality. Savagely he turned on her, snarling
his rage explosively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shrank back, afraid that he was going to
use the whip on her. “Don’t, Rob,” she begged,
face white as the snow in the bank beside the
road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A burro train swung round the bend, and the
man flung away from her and lashed the horses
instead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They camped that night at the mouth of a cañon
and were on the road at daybreak next morning.
The travellers were well into the mountains now.
The spring rains had been heavy and had loosened
the snow on the slopes. Landslides were frequent
and the air was filled with the thunder of avalanches.
The trail itself was treacherous. It was honeycombed
with chuck holes where the mules of pack
outfits had broken through and wallowed in the
mud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American River plunged down a cañon beside
the road. A growth of heavy pines bordered the
trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the gaunt team dragged into the clearing at
Strawberry Flat hundreds of men and scores of teams
were camped there for the night. The animals were
tied to the tongues and sides of the wagons and fed
from long feed-boxes. They were protected from the
cold by heavy canvases lined with blanket stuff. The
men who handled the jerkline and the blacksnake
curled up under the wagons. Soon they were fast
asleep, oblivious to the soft snow that drifted in and
wrapped them about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The driver of the prairie schooner fed and watered
the horses while his wife made supper. She found
dry wood for kindling in the wagon, and the little
girl, who was all thin arms and legs and wild flying
hair, gleefully cleared away snow from the spot
selected. Soon a fire was roaring and little Victoria
was sniffing the savoury odour of a jackrabbit
stew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hopped up and down, first on one foot, then
on the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goody, goody. Le’s hurry up’n eat, Sister
Mollie,” she shouted, waving a spoon excitedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After supper Robert Dodson disappeared into the
nearest grog shop, and his wife retired to the wagon
and nursed a six-weeks-old baby. Victoria washed
the dishes, played around the fire, and after a time
came hop-skipping through the snowflakes to their
canvas-covered home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister Mollie,” announced the child, climbing
nimbly up from the tongue, “when I’m big I’m
gonna marry a prince, ’n he won’t <span class='it'>ever</span> get drunk ’n
beat me like Rob does you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sh-h-h! You mustn’t say such things, Vicky,”
the older sister admonished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’N I’m gonna have shoes without holes in ’em ’n
a dress not all patchy, with gold spangles ’most all
over it. ’N he’ll have a silver chariot ’n great big
white horses with long tails—not jus’ plugs like
ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie sighed and caught the baby in her arms
tighter, so that for a moment the infant stirred restlessly
in its sleep. She, too, had once known dreams
of the fairy prince who was to come riding gallantly
into her life and to carry her irresistibly into the
Land of Romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the tent barroom where her husband had
gone came the words of a drunken chorus:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Exciting times all round the town,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And I’m bound for the land of Washoe.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Mollie recognized the voice of her husband and
then his tipsy laugh. Her slight body shivered
underneath the thin shawl she was wearing.</p>

<h3>THE NIGHT RIDE</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>ugh McClintock</span> drew his horse to a
walk and skirted the base of a hill. He
patted the shiny neck of the bay affectionately.
The boy loved the mounts he rode. His
life depended on their stamina and speed, and they
had never failed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good old Nevada Jim,” he whispered. “We
got a long trail before us through these red devils,
but I reckon we’re good for it, me ’n you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was swinging well to the south of the Silver
Mountains, riding through country covered with
brush. He had been travelling at a rapid pace as he
wound in and out among the sage and greasewood.
Now he had reached the hills that marked the limit
of the range. His intention was to go by way of
Alkali Flat, circle Walker Lake, and cross the Walker
River range. This plan was subject to change, for
at any minute he might run into the Piutes. On the
other hand, which was more likely, he might reach
Carson without having had a glimpse of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boy though he was, he knew Indians. His father
was one of the earliest pioneers in Eagle Valley.
Hugh’s first recollection was of the trip from Salt
Lake through the desert. He recalled that a cow
had worked side by side in the wagon with an ox.
The first plough that had broken a furrow in Nevada
had been made by his father from discarded wagon
tires picked up on the overland road to California.
He remembered the days when Captain Jim in beads
and buckskin and his breech-clothed tribe had hung
around the settlers in pretended friendship. Tame
coyotes instead of dogs had followed them. There
hung in his mind the memory of a morning when he
had gone to the stable to find the horses run off and
the cows stuck full of arrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One adventure he would never forget. His mother
had wakened him at midnight and dressed him
hurriedly. He and his younger brother had been
packed in apple boxes slung on the opposite sides of
a mule. Rifle in hand, his father had walked beside
a second mule upon which Hugh’s mother rode. So
they had crossed the Sierras from Mormon Station
into California, driven from home by the news that
the Indians were raiding the valleys. In his young
life he could recall a hundred such memories of the
dangers and hardships of pioneering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he was still in the hills the brilliant reds and
crimsons of sunset gave way to the soft violet of dusk,
which in turn melted into the deep purple of falling
night. Sometimes, as he wound forward in the
chaparral, he heard the faint rustling of wild shy
creatures scurrying to safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stars had long been out before he reached
Alkali Flat. He was far from any road, but the unerring
instinct of the frontiersman took him, with
many twists and turns, in the direction he had
chosen. Not long after midnight he struck Walker
Lake. He followed the shore line around the
southern point. On a little peninsula he unsaddled,
picketed Nevada Jim, and slept for nearly two hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Darkness was still heavy over the land when he
saddled and retied the mail sacks. He crossed Cat
Creek, turned northwest, and began the hill trek
into the Walker River Range.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Light began to filter into a sky that grew less
opaque. The hills took vague outlines. A meadow
lark’s piping heralded the advent of the young day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put Nevada Jim at the saddle of a hill and
reached the brow that formed part of the lip of a
small saucer-shaped valley beyond. A score of morning
camp-fires shone like glowworms in the misty
hollow. By chance he had stumbled on a party of
Piutes who had probably raided a ranch and come
down here to revel undisturbed. Very likely it was
the same bunch that had waylaid and shot Tim.
There rose to the express rider the pungent smell
of burning meat, and he guessed that the Indians
were indulging in their favourite feast of roasted
horseflesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock made to turn back, but as he did so a
slim breech-clothed figure shot up from the sage
almost at his stirrup. The rider, silhouetted against
the skyline, was a mark hardly to be missed at such
close range even by a Piute with a trade gun. Hugh
dragged Nevada Jim round with fore feet in air, drove
home his spurs, and charged straight at the brave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A red-hot stab seared McClintock’s side. A moment,
and he felt the shock of impact. The sentry was
flung headlong before the weight of the horse, which
staggered over the naked body, trod it under, and
went plunging down the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh heard guttural shouts of alarm from the
valley. Presently, riding along the arroyo below,
he saw horsemen urging their mounts over the
brow of the hill. A shout of triumph told him that
he had been seen by his pursuers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the long strides of the horse carried him down
the arroyo, the boy’s brain functioned to meet the
emergency. He might turn to the right, circle the
lake, make for Alkali Flat, and from there across the
hills on the long stretch for the station. The alternative
was to keep going north, strike across the range,
and point for Carson. Even in this desperate emergency
the morale of the service was the deciding factor.
The mail was due at Carson in a few hours.
With a pressure of his right knee he guided Nevada
Jim up the gulch toward a mountain pass he knew
above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If his horse had been fresh McClintock would have
had small fear of the result. The Indians had no
such ponies as the one he was astride. Their stock
was inferior, just as their rifles were. Moreover, at
their best they were wretched marksmen. But
all the natural advantages of the white man were
neutralized. Nevada Jim was far from fresh. Any
rifle was better than none, and the pony express
rider had to depend on a revolver, good for fast-short-range
work but useless now. He was one
against many, and already he could feel a wet splash
on his shirt when he pressed his hand to his side.
How bad the wound was he did not know, but it was
certain that the long hard ride before him would not
add to his strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A boy of his age, trained in any other school except
the hard outdoor one of the frontier, might
have been forgiven for getting panicky under the
circumstances. But Hugh wasted no nerve force in
fear surges or in self-pity. He had a job to do. He
must do it. That was the simple A B C of his reasoning.
Quite coolly he set his mind to work on the
problem of <span class='it'>how</span> it was to be done, given the conditions
that confronted him. One trouble was that he did
not know those conditions. How long could Nevada
Jim, after the hard hours of travel that lay between
him and the station, keep going at the pace required?
Was he himself likely to collapse suddenly from loss
of blood?</p>

<p class='pindent'>His best chance, he decided, lay in the speed of the
bay. As soon as he had crossed the range—if he
ever got across—he would try to run the Indian
ponies off their legs. If they found they could not
catch him, the Piutes would give up the chase after a
few miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy looked back. The Indians had swept out
of the arroyo and were following him up the gulch.
A dozen of them were bunched, with three or four
trailing behind. But well in front of the group and
going strong was a young brave mounted on a buckskin.
At every stride his horse lengthened the distance
between him and his companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Big Chief Heap-in-a-Hurry aims to collect me,”
the boy told himself aloud. “Me, I got different
notions. Get a hustle on you, Jim. This is one
race where I don’t aim to throw down on myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bay answered the call gallantly. With every
ounce of bone and muscle Nevada Jim flung forward
at the steep trail. The horse gave all it had to give,
breathing heavily as it ploughed up the divide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock had changed his plans. The young
Piute on the buckskin was a factor he could not
ignore. It would never do to drop down from the
hills with this enemy at his heels. The fresher
mount would close in on the bay and the Indian
would pick Hugh off at his leisure. It would be better
to risk all on a bolder, more decisive stroke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With voice and knee and the gentle caress of
hand he urged Nevada Jim to his best. “I know,
old-timer, it’s breakin’ yore heart,” he pleaded.
“But I got to ask it of you—just for a mile or two
more, Jim—till we get to the pass; then that’ll be all,
if our luck stands up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh felt his side again and was alarmed at the
sogginess of the flannel shirt. The pain of the wound
was insistent, but he had no time to worry about
that. What troubled him was the loss of blood. He
might fall out of the saddle from sheer weakness
before he reached safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked back and faintly grinned. The Indians
were beginning to string out, and the gap between
the buckskin and the other horses had widened.
This was exactly what he wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, you Buckskin,” he shouted softly
down the wind. “Don’t you stick around with them
broomtails.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevada Jim’s lungs were pumping hard, but the
clean long legs of the horse still reached with long
strides for the rising ground, the muscular shoulders
moved smoothly and automatically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head of the divide was close now, scarcely a
quarter of a mile in front of the fugitives. Hugh
looked back as he galloped up into the pass. The
buckskin was far in advance of the other pursuers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pass was short and narrow. At the very summit
a huge boulder outcropped from the ridge.
McClintock swung his labouring horse back of this,
and at the same instant leaped to the ground.
Swiftly he unclinched and drew the bay close to the
flat face of the great rock. For the first time since
the wild race had begun he took from its scabbard the
navy revolver he carried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not long to wait. There came the sound
of a hoof striking the hard quartz of the ridge, then
the thud of galloping feet. The express rider tensed
his muscles. He was like a coiled spring as he
crouched back of the boulder, a menace to life as
deadly as a rattlesnake about to strike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Smoothly he slid round the edge of the rock.
The Piute, taken by surprise, jerked the buckskin
sideways and tried to raise his rifle. Lightning
flashed from McClintock’s six-shooter—once, twice.
He dived forward and caught the bridle just as the
redskin tumbled from the horse. The rifle clattered
to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh took one look at the Indian. It was enough.
He would never steal another horse from the whites.
The buckskin, frightened, tried to jerk away. Its
new owner spoke gently, soothingly. He coaxed
the startled animal to the rock and transferred the
saddle from the back of Nevada Jim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already he could hear approaching horses. As
rapidly as possible he cinched and swung astride.
Yet an instant, and he was galloping down the
western slope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he looked back, McClintock saw an Indian’s
head and the upper part of his body rising and
falling with the stride of a horse. He was the first
of the pursuers coming up into the pass. There was
a shout and the sound of a shot. A bullet struck a
spurt of sand from the ground some yards ahead of
the express rider. Other shots came, a scattering
volley of them. Hugh had thrust his smoking revolver
back into the scabbard. He did not attempt
to draw it again. The primary business of the
moment was to get the buckskin into its stride and
widen the distance between him and his enemies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon he was out of range. Bullets were still
falling, but they struck the dust behind him. The
buckskin was fast and willing. Nevada Jim, like
many of the company horses, had a cross of Morgan
blood. This horse was a mustang, but it had unusual
speed and power. Hugh wondered whether the
ranchman who had owned it had been killed when his
place was raided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pursuit continued for several miles, but the
Indians fell always farther to the rear. At last they
dropped out. At least Hugh saw them no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was time. McClintock was faint and dizzy.
He could barely stick to the saddle by clinging with
both hands to the pommel. His wound, irritated by
the constant motion, hurt a great deal. The fever
mounted in his blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The amber dawn gave place to clear day. The sun
climbed high in the heavens. It was noon when the
buckskin picked its way through the East Walker
River to the west bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy could go no farther. He slid down, tied
the horse, and staggered to the water. An odd lightheaded
feeling lifted him from the ground, it seemed.
He floated, imponderable, on waves of air resonant
with music. Then he passed out of all sensation
whatever into unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came to life again placidly and without energy.
When he roused himself to think about it his body
was singularly inert. It was almost as though it
were a thing apart from himself, did not belong to him
at all. He tried heavily with his hand to brush
away the cobwebs from his mind. Then slowly he
remembered what had taken place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The buckskin was still standing patiently beside
the willow to which he had tied it. The sun was
beginning to slant from the west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly he undressed himself in part, washed the
wound with clean water, and tied it up with a
bandage torn from his clothing. His fever was high,
and he bathed his face in the cold water fresh from
the mountain snows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in no condition to travel, but he knew he
would have to stick to the saddle till he reached a
settlement. Even if the Indians had given up the
chase, he could not lie here without food, shelter, or
attention to his wound. When he rose to drag himself
to the horse it took all his grit to set his teeth on
the pain that went through him like a knife thrust.
He could not hold his body erect without agony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somehow he reached the buckskin and pulled
himself to the saddle. He held the pony to a walk,
because this jolted his side less than any other gait.
His mind refused to consider the long hours he must
spend on the rack of torture. Every moment was
sufficient to itself. He would set landmarks for
himself. That scrub cottonwood by the river must
be passed. When that had been reached a bunch of
greasewood ahead became his goal. So, mile by
mile, in a growing delirium, he kept going till he was
far up in the Pine Nut Range.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lost count of time and of distance. He forgot
where he was travelling or why. He remembered
only Indians, and the fear he had resolutely repressed—which
no doubt had been uppermost all the time
in the boy’s subconscious mind—expressed itself
in the babbling of his delirious talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re roostin’ up there in the hills somewheres.
Sure are. Want my topknot for to decorate their
tepees. Hump yoreself, you Nevada Jim. I feel
right spindlin’, an’ I want Mother to fix me up
some sage tea.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They’re after me full
jump. See ’em come lickety split. Aimin’ to
scalp me, all on account that I didn’t stop to say
‘Howdy.’ ” His laughter jangled in the empty
desert, fear for the moment forgotten. “We ce’tainly
lit a-runnin’, me an’ you, Jim, when we jumped up
them Piutes. Clumb for the tall timber, didn’t we,
<span class='it'>amigo viego</span>? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Never did see mountains
dance before. S’lute yore pardners. Grand right
an’ left. Alemane .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here the devils come,
hell for leather. Better not crawl our humps,
eh, Jim? We’ll sure show ’em what for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the buckskin that saved him, that and the
terror which had become an obsession. He clung
to the saddle desperately, long after he no longer
knew the reason for it, long after he had ceased
to guide his mount. Just before nightfall the horse
took him to a Mormon ranch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A comfortable-looking matron, feeding her chickens,
looked up to see the horse and its load motionless
before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lands sake!” she ejaculated, amazed; then raised
her voice in a shout to her husband. “Father,
come here. Buckskin has come home, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She broke off to run to McClintock’s aid. He had
slid from the saddle to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The poor boy,” she cried. “He’s all shot up.
He’s dead, I guess. It’s them Piutes. Help me
get him into the house, Father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a ghost of a smile the wounded boy reassured
her.</p>

<h3>SCOT McCLINTOCK INTRODUCES HIMSELF</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>M</span>ark Twain</span> tells us that in the early
Nevada days it gave a man no permanent
satisfaction to shoot an enemy through both
lungs, because the dry air was so exhilarating that
the wounded foe was soon as good as new. Hugh
McClintock was an illustration of this. He reached
the Mormon settlement a white-faced rag of humanity.
But he had lived hard and clean. The
wind and the sun and able-bodied forbears had given
him a constitution tough as hammered brass.
When his brother Scot drove from Virginia City to
see him, having heard the news that Hugh was
wounded to death, he found the boy wrapped in a
blanket and sitting in the sunshine at the corner of
the ranch house. This was just a week after the
end of the young brother’s wild ride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Lo, Hugh! How are cases?” asked Scot, his
gay smile beaming down at the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine as silk, Scot. I got an appetite like a bear.
Sorry you had to come so far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hooked up soon as I heard about it, old f’ler.
Now I’ve seen you I feel a lot better. The way I
heard it you were ready to cash your chips.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot’s arm was round the lad’s shoulder. The half-caress,
the light in the fine eyes, the warmth of the
voice, all told of the strong affection the older
brother had for the younger. Hugh repaid this
love with interest. In his eyes Scot was an Admirable
Crichton, the most wonderful man he had ever
been privileged to know. He trod the earth a king
among his race—and the king could do no wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No two sons of the same father and mother could
have been more unlike than these. The last-born
was counted steady as an eight-day clock, reliable as
tested steel. The other walked wild and forbidden
paths. Yet to call them unlike is to tell a half-truth.
They had in common courage, a certain cleanness
of fibre, and an engaging gaiety. Scot McClintock
was nearly ten years older than Hugh, but
there was a remarkable physical resemblance between
them. Each had inherited from a Scotch
father eyes of the same colour, a square-cut chin,
and a strong Roman nose. The head of each was
crowned with curls of russet gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shoulders of Scot were broader, his figure less
stringy. He was of splendid physique, tall, compact,
powerful. Bearing himself with manly grace, he
radiated vitality. His chin told the truth. He was
indomitably resolute, a born leader. Vanity was
his weakness. The spectacular appealed. It had
been said of him that he would rather break down a
door than wait for a key. The self-esteem of the
man expressed itself in clothes. These he wore
always for effect, with the knowledge that his fine
figure would win him envy and admiration, even
though he affected the dandy. In his frock coat of
doeskin with its flaring skirt and broad lapels,
his fancy vest cut wide to show a frilled shirt and
blue satin necktie, his pegtop trousers, his immaculately
varnished boots, and his flat-crowned silk
derby, he was out of question the Beau Brummel of
Washoe. Another might have been laughed at for
this punctilious devotion to dress, but even in Virginia
City nobody was hardy enough to poke fun at
Scot McClintock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many smiled with him, for this blue-eyed gambler
had a thousand friends. It was in his horoscope to
fight or share his last dollar with you gladly. He
did not care which. He could be brave, reckless,
generous, sociable, or witty. But nobody could ever
say that he was mean spirited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to take you back with me as soon as
you can travel, Hugh,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll be to-morrow mo’ning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure you can stand the jolting yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. Ask Mother Jessup here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rancher’s wife had come out from the house
and been introduced to Scot. Now she smiled comfortably
at her patient. “He’s doing fine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would, with you looking after him, Madam,”
Scot answered gallantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a God’s mercy he stuck on all those miles,
wounded the way he was. I don’t see how he ever
did,” Mrs. Jessup said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon he clamped his teeth on the job. Hugh’s
right obstinate when he gets set,” the older brother
said with affectionate pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Runs in the family,” Hugh cut back, grinning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe so. Well, tell me all about it, boy.
Where did you jump the Piutes? And how did you
make your getaway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much to tell,” the younger brother replied,
and gave a skeleton outline of the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They started on their journey next morning,
made a short day of it on account of Hugh’s wound,
and put up at Carson for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On what had been known as Eagle Ranch, in the
valley of the same name, the town of Carson had been
built. During the previous decade both Eagle and
Carson valleys had served as a refuge for those who
ran off stolen stock from San Francisco and other
California points. In these hidden parks the outlaws
had been accustomed to rest and feed the herds
before making the desert trip by obscure routes to
Salt Lake. But those days were past. Carson now
had two thousand inhabitants, a boom in town lots,
and a civic consciousness. It had become respectable,
though guns still flashed frequently. Already
it was laying political wires to become the capital
of Nevada, the “battle-born” state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through Carson supplies came by way of Mormon
Station for the diggings at Virginia, along a road
which wound around the base of the hills. As Scot
drove in, the air was musical with chimes. Some of
these came soft and mellow from a great distance.
Each mule of the freight outfits had a circlet of bells
suspended in a steel bow above its collar. They
made music as they moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the hay corral into which McClintock drove,
scores of outfits were gathered, most of them freighters
to or from the diggings. A dozen others could be
heard jingling in, from one direction or the other.
The winter had been a severe one, and hundreds of
cattle in the adjacent valleys had died for lack of
feed. Hay was scarce. There was a very strong
demand for it to feed the freight outfits. Just now
the price was three hundred dollars a ton. Ranchers
found it far more profitable to let their cattle rustle
on bunch grass and take a chance of roughing
through than to feed hay worth such a price. Wherefore
all the native hay went to the stock hauling
supplies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot hailed Baldy Green, a well-known stage
driver. “How about places up on the stage for me
and Hugh to-morrow, old-timer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baldy rubbed the top of his shiny head and grinned
at him. “Full up. Like to ditch a couple of
my passengers for you if I could—a jewellery peddler
and a sky pilot—but I don’t reckon I can, Scot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of the older McClintock sparkled.
“Show ’em to me, Baldy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three minutes later the Beau Brummel of Virginia
City might have been seen in earnest conversation
with a clergyman who hailed from Buffalo, New
York. He was telling the story of the Indian attack
upon his brother and making certain deductions
from it. His manner of grave deference was perfect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But bless my soul, do you really think the redskins
are likely to attack the stage to-morrow?”
asked the startled missionary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t tell, sir. They were certainly heading this
way when last seen. Big chance of it, I’d say. I’m
a sinner—a professional gambler. What does it
matter about me? But you—the only minister of
the Gospel in a hundred miles—you can’t be spared.
The harvest is ripe for the reaper. Why not wait
here a day or two and make sure the Piutes are not
around?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The missionary was frankly frightened, but he had
in him the stuff of heroes. His lower lip became
a thin straight line of resolution. No professional
gambler should put his courage to shame. If he
rode through the valley of the shadow he had a
promise from Holy Writ to comfort him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go if the stage goes,” he said stoutly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot McClintock knew when he was beaten temporarily.
But he was not the man to give up a
point upon which he had set his heart. He looked
up a friend of his, the mayor of the town, drew him
aside, and whispered persuasively in his ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fat little man with whom he talked exploded a
protest. “But doggone it, Scot, if the Gospel shark
accepts, won’t I have to go to his meetin’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe so. What of it? Be a good scout,
Adams. I want that boy of mine to get up to Virginia
to-morrow so that I can make him comfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mayor grinned. “Never saw your beat for
gettin’ your own way. All right. I’ll rustle up
some of the women and ask him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot dropped into the What Cheer House and
glanced around. The jewellery salesman was sitting
in a corner by himself. McClintock introduced
himself and invited the stranger to a rum cocktail
or a whisky sling. In five minutes he knew all
about the peddler’s business and how much he hoped
to make from the sale of his stock at Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why not sell it here in Carson? The town’s
booming. Lots of money here. More women. Up
in Virginia they can’t think anything except mines,”
Scot suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friendt, I make more at Virginia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you know your business better than I do.
Hope we get through without trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trouble? Vat kind of trouble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Injuns on warpath. They shot up my brother.
I’m taking him up with me to a doctor. From the
way the Piutes were heading I rather expect an attack
on the stage to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peddler rose to the bait, excitedly, with shrill
voice. “And I haf paid my fare to Virginia. It’s an
outrage. I vill demand a refund. I vill sue the
company. I vill nodt travel in onsavety. You are
right, my friendt. I sell my stock right here in Carson
if I get a refund.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would,” agreed McClintock sympathetically,
“I know Baldy Green. Let’s see if he’ll stand for the
refund.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stage driver played up to his friend with a
serious face. It was not customary to make refunds.
He had a kind of hunch the stage would
get through without being attacked. But if the
gentleman wanted to stay at Carson and if McClintock
would guarantee him against loss to the
company through an empty seat, probably it could
be arranged. Incidentally, he mentioned that he
had just heard from the clergyman cancelling his
passage. He had been urged by a deputation of
Carson citizens to stay in town over Sunday and
preach on the plaza. This call, he felt, could not be
ignored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baldy called Scot back as he was leaving. The
stage driver’s face was one wrinkled grin. “You
ce’tainly take the cake, old alkali. I got to give it
to you. Afraid the stage will be attacked, are you?
Dad gum yore hide, you know Injuns won’t dare
come up here on the peck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d hate to have the jewellery gentleman take
any chances,” Scot explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And preachin’ on the plaza. Don’t you know
there’s hawss racin’ here every Sunday?” cackled
Baldy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Competition is the life of trade. The ladies can
meet an’ pray for their wicked husbands. They
need it, don’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure do. Well, I got no kick comin’. I won’t
be here Sunday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither was Scot. He and his brother travelled
Virginiaward in the morning. The “mud-wagon”
had been left at Carson. They travelled in a beautiful
painted Concord stage behind six high-stepping
chestnuts decked with ivory rings, silver tassels, and
expensive harness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baldy drove superbly. He and his kind were
knights of the road. The wranglers and attendants
were deferential to them, the public viewed them
admiringly as celebrities. Baldy drew on his gauntlets
slowly, mounted to the box, and took the ribbons
from the hand of a hostler. There was a swift
tightening of the reins, a sweeping crack of the whip.
The leaders came round on the run, the swings at a
gallop, and the wheelers at a trot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ride to Virginia was one worth taking. The
road wound round curves, dropped into draws, swept
along dugways beneath which were deep precipices.
When he hit the curves Baldy gave the wheels play.
Occasionally one of the back ones hung precariously
over space. A minute later the stage perhaps had
struck a level and the driver was riding the brakes
while the horses dashed wildly forward. Ten miles
an hour, up hill and down, over the precipitous
mountain road, the chestnuts travelled wildly, every
foot of the way guided by the man on the box who
handled them coolly and expertly. Meanwhile,
Baldy discussed casually with Scot McClintock the
news of the day. With his whip he pointed to a
bad turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hank Monk went over the grade yesterday—coach,
hawsses, and passengers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much damage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nope—none a-tall. Nary a beast skinned.
Paint on coach hardly scratched. Busted one tenderfoot’s
laig. That’s all. Mighty lucky spill. Hank
always did fall on his feet. Been me I’d prob’ly
a-hurted one of the animals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky for all parties except the tenderfoot,”
agreed Scot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep. Couldn’t a-been better. G’lang!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The long whip snaked out with a crack like the
sound of an exploding gun. The coach leaped forward,
swaying like a cradle set on wheels. They
were drawing close to Virginia now, and the whole
desert was staked like the sole of a giant shoe.
American Flat fell away to the rear. The chestnuts
raced up Gold Hill and the Ophir Grade, across the
divide, and down into Virginia City, which was
perched on the lower slope of Mt. Davidson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The town was an uncouth and windswept camp,
but it represented uncounted hopes and amazing
energy. In this mass of porphyry lay the fabulously
rich Comstock Lode, from which in a single generation
nearly a billion dollars’ worth of ore was to be
taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Concord dropped down into B Street, the
horses covering the home stretch at a gallop. Baldy
brought the coach along the rough street at a dead
run, sweeping it skillfully around a train of wood-packed
burros. He stopped exactly in front of the
company’s office, twined the reins around the brake
bar, and smiled at Scot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yore friend the peddler will feel sold when he hears
you wasn’t scalped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The scenery flew past so fast I couldn’t tell
whether it was punctuated with Piutes or not,” said
Scot genially, as he swung down to help Hugh from
inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The younger McClintock stepped out stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hope I didn’t mix yore inside geography too
much,” Baldy asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all right. The docs say the inside of a stagecoach
is first rate for the inside of a man,” Hugh
answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tha’s right, too—for a well man; but they don’t
say it’s a sure cure for one the Injuns have been
playin’ with, do they? Well, so long, young fellow.
Don’t you let that rip-snortin’ brother o’ yours
c’rupt you none.”</p>

<h3>SCOT PASSES THE HAT</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>hrough</span> the throngs that crowded, not
only the dilapidated sidewalks, but also the
street itself, Scot guided his brother deftly
toward the hotel. The whole appearance of the
place was still higgledy-piggledy. Men lived in
tents, in dugouts, in prospect holes, in shacks built
of dry-goods boxes, canvas sacks, and brush. They
cooked and ate as best they could, while they went
about their business of prospecting or buying and
selling “feet”<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> in what by courtesy were called
mines.</p>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<div class='footnote'>
<p class='footnote'>
<span class='footnote-id' id='f4'><a href='#r4'>[4]</a></span>

In Virginia City mining interests were then sold by feet, and not by
shares.—W. M. R.</p>

</div>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll cut across this lot,” the gambler suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mud-stained wagon with a dirty canvas top had
been unhitched close to the street. Two bony and
dejected horses were tied to the wheels eating
some brush that they were trying to persuade themselves
was hay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh commented on the broomtails. “So thin
they won’t throw a shadow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later he was sorry, for as they rounded
the wagon he saw a woman and child crouched over
a camp fire. They were cooking a stew. A man sat
on the wagon tongue smoking. He looked at the
passing men out of sullen, clouded eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A voice from the sidewalk drifted to the brothers.
“Trouble, looks like. Sam Dutch has got Red Mike
backed up against the bar of the Mile High, and he’s
tryin’ to devil him into drawing a six-shooter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the heels of the words there came the sound of
a shot, followed by a second. A swift trampling of
many feet, and the side door of the Mile High burst
open. Men poured out of it as seeds are squirted
from a pressed lemon. They dived in every direction
to escape. After them came a single man, bare-headed,
a revolver in his hand. He looked wildly
round, then fled to the shelter of the wagon for
safety. A huge fellow, bellowing like a bull, tore
out of the saloon in pursuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An ironclad rule of the old fighting West is that
every quarrel is a private one. No outsider has any
right to interfere. Under ordinary conditions, the
first impulse of the McClintocks would have been
to dive for cover. The West considers it no reflection
on a man’s courage for him to sing small when
guns are out to settle a difference of opinion which
is no concern of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The McClintocks, as though moved by the same
spring, wheeled in their tracks and ran back to the
wagon. The man on the tongue was disappearing
into the bed through the opening in the canvas.
But the woman and the little girl, terror-stricken,
stood spellbound beside the fire. Pursued and
pursuer were charging straight toward them. A
bullet struck with a metallic clang the iron pot in the
live coals. The child screamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roughly the woman and the little girl went down
at the same instant, flung to the ground by the
impact of flying bodies. They heard more shots,
but they knew nothing of what was going on. For
the McClintock brothers were crouched above them,
shielding them from the danger of wild bullets.
They did not see the red-headed man stumble and
pitch forward, nor did they see the big ruffian at his
heels fling shot after shot into his prostrate form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh released his weight from the child, and
lifted her to her feet in such a way that her face was
turned from the tragedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Run right along into the wagon where yore dad
is, li’l girl, and don’t turn yore head,” he said, and
his voice was very gentle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved forward, whimpering as she went, and
climbed to the wagon tongue. But, just as she was
about to vanish inside, curiosity or some other impulse
swung round her black and shaggy little head.
Big dark eyes fastened on Hugh, then moved past
him to the awful thing she was to see in her dreams for
many a night. A man, red-haired and red-bearded,
lay face up on the ground, sightless eyes staring up
at the blue sky. A second man straddled the body
with brutal triumph, a big slouchy fellow with coarse
tawny hair reaching to his neck, and sandy whiskers
tied under his chin. He wore a brown Peruvian hat,
a blue army overcoat with a cape, and a woollen
shirt. From his bootleg a horn-handled bowie knife
projected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wanted to be chief,<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> eh?” the murderer jeered in
a heavy overbearing voice. “There’ll be only one
chief in Virginia while Sam Dutch is here. If any
one else wants the job, he’ll gets his like Red Mike
did.” He shuffled away, Spanish spurs jingling,
slouching and slow of movement. His gestures were
heavy, except when shooting. No bad man in
Washoe was quicker on the draw.</p>

It was a matter of pride among the desperadoes of Nevada in early
days to be cock of the walk. Many a “bad man” died with his boots
on because he aspired to be “chief” among his fellows. So long as these
ruffians killed each other, the community paid little attention to their
murders. When good citizens fell victim, a sentiment was created which
eventually resulted in the supremacy of law.—W. M. R.</p>

</div>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>A faint trickle of smoke still issued from the barrel
of his revolver as he thrust it back into its scabbard,
where it could be seen beneath the flapping coat tails.
He disappeared into the Mile High and proceeded
to down half-a-dozen gin slings at the expense of
friends who did not dare withhold this tribute of
admiration lest he make one of them number eleven
on his list. An hour later, Scot McClintock saw him
there, in drunken slumber lying on a billiard table,
the brute primordial, first among the bad men of the
lawless camp because he was its most deadly ruffian.
There were those who would have liked to make an
end of him as he lay soddenly asleep, but he was so
quick and terrible that their fear was greater than
the lust to kill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot helped from the ground the woman he had
thrown. She looked at him, her breast rising and
falling deep, fear still quick in the soft brown eyes.
Her cheeks were white as the snow on Mt. Davidson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam, I’m sorry I was rough,” Scot said,
and gave her the most gallant bow in Washoe.
“But you were in the line of fire. I couldn’t take
chances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emotion shook her. A faint colour crept timidly
into her face. She said, in a voice hardly audible:
“You saved my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t go that far,” the man answered, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something eager, beautiful, made of the woman’s
eyes soft stars of night. “I’ll never forget—never,”
she promised, with a strangled sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a low jangling laugh at her shoulder.
“Tha’s right. Always a fool if you can find a chance
to be one, Moll,” a voice sneered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light died from the woman’s eyes, the colour
from her cheeks. She became at once a creature lifeless,
without spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot turned, voice soft and suave. “Did you find
what you went to look for in the wagon, sir?” he
asked, raking the unkempt unclean emigrant with
scornful eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dull flush burned into the man’s face. A furtive
darting look slid from the yellow-gray eyes. It
carried menace, as does sometimes that of a tamed
wolf toward its trainer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I didn’t notice where Moll was when I
started,” he said with sullen reluctance. “An’ I
reckon tha’s <span class='it'>my</span> business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so,” agreed the gambler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed again to the woman in the cheap patched
homespun, met the eyes of his brother, and turned to
go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the wagon came a weak little wail. The McClintocks
stood rooted in their tracks. Again the
puling cry was raised. With a murmured exclamation
the woman excused herself hurriedly and climbed
into the covered wagon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you got a baby there?” asked Scot, a new
note in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father grunted a sulky “Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A baby, Hugh. An honest-to-God baby. The
first in Virginia City. What do you think about
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could we see it, do you reckon?” the younger
brother asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot turned on him reproving eyes. “I’m surprised
at you, Hugh. That baby’s being—fed—right
now.” Suddenly he wheeled on the emigrant.
“Boy or girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great. We’ll call her Virginia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her name’s Susan,” the father growled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No matter. We’ll change it. Last name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dodson. Her name’s goin’ to stay right what
it is now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A crowd of men had poured upon the vacant lot
to view the scene of the killing. Some were removing
the body to an adjacent saloon, others were discussing
the affair guardedly from its dramatic and not from
its ethical standpoint. There was no question of
ethics in an ordinary killing if both combatants had
had ample warning. It was the boast of Virginia,
just as it was later of Austin, Pioche, Aurora, and the
other Nevada camps, that it had “a man for breakfast”
each day. This was not the literal truth, but
it was too nearly true for comfort. The diggings
were infested with wild, lawless criminals driven from
more settled communities. They robbed stages,
held up citizens, and maintained the rule of the six-gun
among communities the great majority of whose
residents would much have preferred peace and order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot climbed into the bed of an empty ore wagon
and clapped his hands for silence. Only those in his
immediate vicinity heard him, wherefore Scot got
what he wanted by the simple expedient of firing his
revolver into the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment there was the threat of a stampede,
but not after the discovery that McClintock had
fired the gun. Scot was known as a professional
gambler, a respectable business man who did not kill
wantonly. It was evident that he wanted to make a
speech. Anything in reason that Scot McClintock
wanted in Virginia City he could have. He was the
most popular man in camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to it, Scot. Onload heap much oration,”
someone shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After which there was silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boys,” Scot began simply, “I’m going to tell
you something that will please you a lot. We’ve
got a baby in camp, a real, genuine, blown-in-the-bottle
guaranteed baby, the first one that ever hit
Virginia City. It’s a lady baby, and her name’s
Susan. Now, we’ve none of us got anything against
Susan. It’s a good name. But it’s not the name for
our baby. We’re going to name that kid Virginia
or know why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wild howl of approval lifted into the air. The
emotions of Washoe were direct and primitive.
This was the sort of thing that made its sure appeal.
These men were far from their womenkind and the
ties of home. Many of them had slipped into ways
that would have shocked their sheltered relatives
in older communities. But they were sentimental
as schoolgirls. A baby was the symbol of all the
happiness they had left behind when they undertook
the lonesome hardships of gold hunting. They
cheered and shouted and shook hands with each
other in deep delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going to give this kid a good send-off,
because she’s our baby. Virginia is her name and
Virginia is her home. I’m going to pass the hat,
boys. You, El Dorado Johnnie and Jean Poulette
and Six-Fingered Pete and Murphy Davis get your
hats off and circulate among these Washoe millionaires
and bummers. Dig deep into your jeans, every
last one of you. We’re going to do the right thing
by this little lady the good Lord has sent us. Whoop
’er up now,” adjured McClintock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From every direction men came running to this
new form of entertainment. Saloons and gambling
houses emptied. The streets began to pack. Still
the jingling of coins dropping into hats could be
heard. Everybody gave. Scot appointed a committee
to count the spoils and another committee to
invite the town’s brass band down to the reception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile he whispered in Hugh’s ear and the
boy carried a message to the prairie schooner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to see Mrs. Dodson,” he told that lady’s
husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dull, unimaginative face of the man was lit
with cupidity and suspicion. It surely was not
possible that all this money was going to be turned
over to him just because he had a baby. The world
couldn’t possibly be so full of fools. Yet it looked
like it. He called his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came out to the tent flap with the baby in her
arms. All this noise and confusion frightened her a
little, but it did not disturb the tousled little girl by
her side. It was meat and drink to her. Her eyes
snapped with excitement. She had an inkling of
what was going on, and she wriggled like a small,
pleased puppy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh took off his hat. “Madam, we’d like to
borrow for a little while yore family. We’re figurin’
on a sort of a parade, and we want the baby in it.
We’d like to have you an’ the li’l girl go along to see
the baby’s taken care of proper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goody, goody!” Victoria hopped from one foot
to the other as a register of approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman hesitated. Her glance fluttered
timidly to the husband. “I don’t know. What do
you think, Rob?” Then, in a low voice: “I haven’t
anything to wear. Perhaps you could take Baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy interposed hurriedly. “That’s not quite
the idea, ma’am. The boys are kinda hungry to see
a sure enough mother and baby. It would be a
kindness to them if you’d come yoreself. We’ll have
the stage, an’ you can ride beside the driver. O’
course we don’t aim to be bossy about it, but our
hearts are real set on this.” He smiled, and Hugh’s
boyish grin was a winsome argument. It had the
touch of sweet deference women liked. “They’re
rough looking, ma’am, but none of these miners
would hurt you for the world. It’s a celebration for
the camp’s first baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let’s go, Sister Mollie,” urged Victoria. “I
wantta ride in the pee-rade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman whispered with her husband. He
broke out roughly: “Don’t be so damned finicky.
Your dress is all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll come,” the young woman told the boy.
“In a few minutes we’ll be ready. And thank you
for wanting us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot McClintock presently arrived himself and
escorted the guests of honour to the stage. He assisted
the young mother to the seat beside Baldy
and passed the baby up to her. The infant was a
plump little thing with fat dimpled arms and legs.
It crowed up into Scot’s face and gurgled happily
at him. Vicky was lifted up to the seat next her
sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As master of ceremonies Scot, in a long red sash,
mounted on a beautiful white horse, rode at the
head of the procession. The stage came next, followed
by Virginia’s young and exuberant brass
band. After this marched the fire organizations
in their red shirts and helmets. Empty ore wagons
fell into line and were quickly filled with miners. A
mixed crowd of residents on foot brought up the
rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The contributions already collected had been
poured from the hats into a tub. This was tied to
the back of the stage, in the place where trunks and
packages usually rested. All along A Street and
back along B Street men fought to get at the tub
with their money. The band played “Old Dan
Tucker” and other popular airs, but out of deference
to a divided public opinion did not give either
“Yankee Doodle” or “Dixie.”<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a> There were speeches,
of course, full of bombast, eloquence, and local
patriotism, all of which were vociferously applauded.</p>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<div class='footnote'>

<span class='footnote-id' id='f6'><a href='#r6'>[6]</a></span>

The Civil War was being fought at this time, and though Nevada was
far from the scene of action, sectional feeling was high. A fairly large
minority of those in Virginia City and Carson were Southerners—W.
M. R.</p>

</div>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was while the band was playing that the guest
of honour began to cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop that damn band and give the kid a chance,”
someone shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hundred light-hearted sons of mirth took up
the word. The band stopped in the middle of a bar,
and to her mother’s embarrassment Miss Virginia
Dodson entertained with a solo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The marshal of the parade rode back to the coach
and smiled up at the young mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t mind the boys,” he advised. “It’s just
their way of showing how much they think of our
baby. You know, ma’am, this town claims the
young lady. We’ve adopted her, but if you say
‘Please’ real nice we’ll let you bring her up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie’s bosom warmed within her. A lump rose
in her throat and her eyes misted. For years she
had been the chattel of Robert Dodson, a creature
to be sneered at, derided, and beaten. This splendid-looking
hero of romance treated her as though she
were a lady. She wondered who he could be.
Among all these rough-bearded miners he shone like
diamonds in a mud heap. His clothes, manner,
speech, the musical intonation of his voice, all set
him apart from other men, she thought, even if his
figure and face had not marked him for distinction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A big blond lawyer with a long yellow beard was
at the head of the committee appointed to count the
money. His name was William M. Stewart. Later
he represented Nevada in the United States Senate
for many years. At the request of Scot McClintock
he made the presentation speech, the baby in his
arms at the time. The total amount collected ran
over thirty-two hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert Dodson had been drinking more or less
all day. He had taken the opportunity to celebrate
rather steadily during the parade, since, as father of
Virginia, he had been offered a nip at many bottles.
Now he unwisely presented himself to take charge of
the fund raised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stewart looked at him carefully, then exchanged
glances with Scot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friends,” said the future Senator, “I move a committee
of three to take charge of Miss Virginia’s educational
fund. If this is satisfactory I shall ask the
citizens of the camp to name the trustees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was so voted. When the time came to name
the custodians of the fund the crowd shouted
“McClintock” and “Stewart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big blond lawyer consulted with Scot. “Mr.
McClintock and I are glad to serve as trustees in
your behalf, gentlemen,” announced Stewart. “With
your permission we shall name Robert Dodson, the
father of Virginia, as the third member.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the months that followed, Dodson flew into a
rage whenever the trust fund was mentioned. He
insinuated to his cronies over the bar that McClintock
and Stewart were manipulating the money to
their own advantage. The fact was that they refused
to let their co-trustee get his fingers on any of
it to dissipate.</p>

<h3>HUGH SITS IN</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>F</span>rom</span> every state and many nations the
pioneers of California came, young, ardent,
hopeful, strong. Round the Horn in clipper
ships, across the fever-swept Isthmus, by way of the
long Overland Trail, they poured into the Golden
West. They laughed at hardship. They wrote
songs of defiance to bad luck and sang them while
they worked and starved and died. Self-contained
and confident, they gutted mountains, made deserts
leafy green, built cities that were the marvel of
their generation. To these sunset shores came the
pick of the world’s adventurous youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevada absorbed the best and the worst of California’s
seasoned veterans. Gay, reckless, debonair,
the gold-seekers went their turbulent way. Every
man was a law to himself, carried in his holster the
redress for wrongs. The wildest excesses prevailed.
The most brutal crimes went unpunished. For
years there was no night at Virginia, at Austin, or at
Eureka. The flare from dance halls, hurdy-gurdys,
and gambling houses flung splashes of light on masses
of roughly dressed men engaged in continual revelry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it would be unjust to condemn Washoe because
it did not measure up to the standards of Philadelphia.
At its worst no good woman was ever more
revered than here, no child’s innocence more zealously
guarded. And, as it proved, the strength of the
bad man lacked the endurance of the one who was
good. Law and order came to Nevada, brought by
stalwarts who took their lives in their hands to
punish desperadoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dominance of law came slowly, because
Washoe was under the jurisdiction of Utah, so far
away across the desert that its authority was only a
shadow. Until this handicap was taken away, no
real civil authority was possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The earliest mining at Virginia was done from the
grass roots, which fact accounts largely for the
character of its population. Six-Mile Cañon heads
on the north side of Mt. Davidson, Gold Cañon
about a mile distant on its south slope. Placer
miners, working among the decomposed rock and
gravel of the ravines, moved up toward the mother
lode without knowing it. The clay in which they
dug was so tough it had to be “puddled” in water
with shovels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the formation of the strata had convinced the
astute that the Washoe diggings were a quartz
proposition. The rocker and the long tom had had
their day. Into the Ophir and the Gould &amp; Curry,
steam hoists had been put. The shafts were going
deeper every hour. Much litigation developed,
due in part to defective location work and disputes
as to veins. This brought to the territory the ablest
bar on the Pacific Coast. Among the newspaper
reporters who worked a few months later on the
<span class='it'>Territorial Enterprise</span> was Mark Twain. He was
one of a dozen brilliant writers who later were
known from coast to coast, all of whom were associated
with the Goodwins on this paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No other such mining camp ever existed. Side
by side with lawlessness and the roughest makeshifts
there existed a high civilization which was satisfied
with nothing less than the best. In the days to
come, after the town had found its feet, McCullough,
Booth, Barrett, and Modjeska played at Piper’s
Opera House within a stone’s throw of the raucous
uproar of the hurdy-gurdy houses. One lucky
miner expressed himself in a mansion equipped with
door stops of gold and door knobs of silver; another
lifted his eyes to the stars and wrote his soul out
with fire-tipped pen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this heterogeneous society there was at first no
class consciousness. The professional gambler had
a special standing. He was accepted as necessary
to the community, much as a doctor or a merchant
was. He set the standard of dress and of manners.
If he was a “square sport” he played a fair game.
The most distinguished men in the camp were glad
to sit down at poker with such a gambler as Scot
McClintock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So long as the road from California was open
Virginia City lived on the best that could be imported.
But during the heavy winter just ending the trail
had been closed for months. Food was dangerously
short. The supply of potatoes and onions, the staple
vegetables, had become completely exhausted.
There was very little fresh meat, though jackrabbits
were fortunately plentiful. To make conditions
worse, soft heavy spring snows blocked the passes
and made transportation impossible. At Placerville
and at Strawberry Flat great trains of supplies
waited for the opening of the trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On a sunny windswept afternoon Scot McClintock
made his way from the International Hotel to the
Crystal Palace, where he dealt faro to a high-priced
clientele. He was pleasantly at peace with the world.
If he carried a derringer in his pocket it was as a
concession to the custom of a country where every
man went armed. His progress along B Street
and through the Crystal Palace to his seat was in the
nature of a reception. For everybody knew Scot
and wanted to claim acquaintance with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded to the players, slid into his chair, and
began to deal. His face took on the gambler’s mask
of impassivity. This mask did not lift when a
heavy-set huge man slouched into the Crystal Palace
and to the corner where McClintock presided.
Someone hastily moved aside to give the newcomer a
place. Nobody in Virginia City disputed any question
of precedence with Sam Dutch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The desperado had been drinking. It was apparent
to all that he was in an ugly humour. Gradually,
inconspicuously, the players at that end of the
hall cashed in their chips and departed from the
immediate vicinity. Scot continued to deal with a
wooden face, but behind his expressionless eyes was a
wary intentness. Dutch meant trouble. He had
come with the deliberate intention of making it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Friends had brought to McClintock the word that
he had better look out for Dutch. The bad man
was jealous of his popularity, his influence in the
camp, and above all of the fearlessness that would
not accept intimidation. Shrewdly, with that instinct
for safety common to all killers, the fellow
had chosen his moment well. All the advantage
would lie with him. The hands of the dealer must
be above the table sliding out cards. His own could
be on the butts of his six-shooters before he called
for a showdown. What Dutch proposed was not a
duel but deliberate cold-blooded murder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot knew this. He knew, too, that if either of his
hands lifted for an instant from the cards the ruffian
opposite would fling slug after slug into his body.
Nor could he expect any help from the lookout for
the game. Dutch was too sure on the shoot to tempt
interference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The roulette wheel continued to turn. The stud
and draw poker games went on. Automatically
men made their bets, but the interest was gone
from their play. The atmosphere had grown electric.
The furtive attention of everybody focussed on two
men, the killer and the victim he had selected.
When would Dutch find his excuse to strike? In
the tenseness of the suspense throats parched and
nerves grew taut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The contrast between the two men was striking.
The one dealing the cards was clean-cut, graceful,
and lithe as a tiger. From head to foot he was
trim and well-groomed. Even the fingernails were
polished pink in the latest San Francisco fashion.
The huge man in front of him was dirty, his hair and
beard unkempt, his figure slouchy. The long army
overcoat he wore was splashed with mud. He looked
the incarnation of brute force dominated by craft
instead of intelligence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into the Crystal Palace a lean sun-and-wind
browned man walked. He was about to start back
to take his run on the pony express and he had come
in to say good-bye to his brother. With one clear-eyed
steady look he realized the situation. The
gunman had not yet called for a showdown. He
meant to choose his own time for fastening the
quarrel on Scot. His rage might still be diverted into
another channel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh did his thinking as he moved lightly forward.
There was not a break in his stride as he
walked straight to the faro table. Carelessly, it
appeared, but really by cool design, he chose the
place next to Dutch, close to him and on his right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t crowd, young fella,” warned the bully
heavily. “Me, when I play, I want room a-plenty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pony express rider tossed a twenty-dollar
gold piece on the table. “Chips,” he said, without
even looking at Dutch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of the McClintocks met. Hugh was no
gambler. He was sitting in, Scot knew, to share and
lessen the risk. If he could draw the gunman’s
attention for even an instant at the critical moment
it might save the dealer’s life. A stack of chips slid
across to the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big ruffian slammed down a fist like a ham, so
that the chips jumped. “Didja hear me speak, kid?
Know who I am?” he blustered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun streamed full on the boy’s fair curly head
from the window above. It brought out the faint
golden down on his lean cheek and emphasized a
certain cherubic innocence of gaze that still lingered
from his childhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no, I don’t reckon I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Sam Dutch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh coppered two of the big man’s bets and
played the jack to win. “Knew a fellow called
Dutch once—hanged for stealing sheep from the
Mormons. No kin, maybe,” he said cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lookout stirred uneasily, then stepped from
the place where he sat and disappeared through a
side door. The cards slid out of the box. Hugh
won both bets he had coppered. Scot sized up
chips to match the bets, and the boy drew them in
with his left hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch turned to him a face distorted as a gargoyle.
“Play yore own game and keep off’n the cards I
play. An’ don’t get heavy with me,” he snarled with
an oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure not,” Hugh promised amiably. “It was
down on the Humboldt Sink they hanged him, I
recollect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bad man thrust his unkempt head closer.
“Get outa here. You’re crowdin’ me. I don’t
want my private graveyard to hold no kid-size
coffins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Room for both of us,” said Hugh coolly, and he
did not give a fraction of an inch. Instead, he coppered
another of the camp bully’s bets, playing the
ace to lose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not room for me an’ you here both. I tell you
I’m Sam Dutch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot slid out the cards. The ace lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I heard you—no need to shout,” Hugh said
tranquilly, reaching for his winnings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch brushed his arm aside roughly. He raked
in the chips. “I’ll collect on that ace,” he announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You played it to win and it lost,” Hugh told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I?” The killer was dangerously near explosion
point. “Don’t forget, young fella, that I’m
chief in this town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh looked straight at him, his blue eyes narrowed
ever so little. “So? Who elected you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This cool defiance from an unknown smooth-cheeked
boy put the match to the ruffian’s rage. He
snatched from his head the Peruvian hat and stamped
it under his feet. His teeth ground savagely. He
stooped as though to leap, and as he did so his
fingers closed on the horn handle of the bowie projecting
from his boot leg. The long blade flashed
in the sunlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost simultaneously a derringer and a navy
revolver flamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stupid puzzled expression gathered on the face of
the man in the army overcoat. He seemed to be
groping for the meaning of what had happened.
The huge body swayed and the bowie clattered to
the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both brothers watched the killer intently. Neither
fired a second shot, though every sense, nerve, and
muscle waited in readiness for instant action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch clutched at the faro table with both hands,
then unexpectedly pitched forward upon it, scattering
chips and cards in all directions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From behind the bar, from back of chairs and
tables, men cautiously emerged. Others gathered
themselves from the floor where they had been lying
low. The lookout stuck a head carefully through the
side doorway. There would be no more shooting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot spoke quietly. “I take you-all to witness,
gentlemen, that he came here looking for trouble.
My brother and I fired in self-defence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Someone thrust a hand under the big body and
pushed aside the blue coat. “Heart’s still beating,”
he announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then send for a doctor and have him looked after.
I’ll pay the bill,” Scot said, still in an even expressionless
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hadn’t you better finish the job?” a voice whispered
in Hugh’s ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh turned, dizzy with nausea. “God, no!” he
answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he lives he’ll get you sure—both of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not murderers,” the boy said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He groped his way to a chair and sat down quickly.
Was he going to faint?</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hand fell on his shoulder. Through a haze Scot’s
voice came warm and low: “Good old Hugh.
Saved my life sure. You were that cool—and game.
Every move you made counted. If you hadn’t
devilled him till he lost his head he’d likely have
got one of us. Boy, I’m proud of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh was ashamed of his weakness. “I didn’t
play the baby this away when I got that Piute at
the pass,” he said apologetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing to it, boy. You came through fine.
Except for you—well, I would have cashed in.
Come. Let’s get out of here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The owner of the Crystal Palace was standing near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you get someone else to finish my shift?”
Scot asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.” The proprietor did a little legitimate
grumbling. “There’s sixty-five saloons in this town,
an’ I’ll be doggoned if everybody doesn’t come here
to do their gun stuff. Seems like a man will walk
clear up from Gold Hill so’s to pull off his fireworks
at the Crystal. It don’t do business no good, lemme
tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re out of luck,” his dealer smiled. “But we
couldn’t really help it this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t say you could, Scot. I won’t mourn for
Sam Dutch if you’ve got him. All I say is I try to
run a quiet, respectable place an’ looks like I never
get a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brothers walked out to the street. Patrons
of the place fell back to let them pass and followed
with their eyes the two straight, light-stepping men.
Hugh was still a little stringy in build, but even in
his immaturity it would have been hard to find a
more promising-looking youngster. As for Scot, he
was acknowledged to be the handsomest man in
the diggings. No woman ever saw him pass without
wanting to look at him twice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news had swept through town already, and as
the brothers walked down the street a hundred men
stopped to shake hands with and congratulate them.
But even now they whispered their approval. It was
possible Dutch might survive his wounds, in which
case they were prepared to resume ostensible neutrality.
The killer’s name was one that sent the
chills down the backs of even courageous men. He
was more deadly than a rattlesnake because he usually
did not give warning before he struck.</p>

<h3>VICKY TELLS SECRETS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>fter</span> what had just taken place at the
Crystal Palace the bright sunshine of Nevada
was welcome to both brothers. Inside the
gambling house had been unwholesome excitement,
passion, the dregs of cruel murder lust, and the
shadow of death. In the open street were friendly
faces, a sane world going about its business, and
God’s sun in the heavens. The McClintocks had
probably snuffed out a life. It had been one horribly
distorted by evil. None the less, it shook their
composure to have sent even such a soul to its last
account. They wanted, if possible, to forget completely
the look on the face of that huge figure collapsing
upon the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little girl stood squarely in front of them on the
broken sidewalk. To the casual eye she appeared
all patches, flying hair, and knobby legs. There was
the shy wildness of a captured forest creature in her
manner, but in her small body the McClintocks
sensed, too, a dauntless spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mister Goodmans,” she said, addressing them
both, “don’t you ’member me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. You’re Vicky,” Scot told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came directly to business. “Rob, he’s ’most
always drunk ’n we ain’t got nothin’ to eat. Mollie
’n me’s jist awful hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hungry? Good Lord!” cried Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His brother took charge of the situation. “Go in
to Groton’s with Vicky and get her a good dinner.
I’ll see what supplies I can pick up and go down to
the wagon with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In front of the Delta saloon Scot met a Washoe
Indian. He was carrying a half a sack of wild
onions he had brought to town to trade. McClintock
did business with him on the spot. At Lyman
Jones’s store the faro dealer bought some rice and
coffee. He also induced the merchant to let him
have the last five pounds of flour he had in stock.
With these supplies he tramped to the edge of town
to the place where the Dodsons had moved their camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ploughed through heavy sand, up a steep slope
of shale and loose rubble, to a narrow flat where the
prairie schooner stood. Mollie Dodson must have
heard him coming, for as he reached the wagon she
called from within:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you find Rob, Vicky?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps the firmness of his tread told her at once of
her mistake. She leaned out of the open flap and
caught sight of Scot. Into her white face the colour
beat in waves. Startled eyes held to his with a surprised
question in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I was looking for Vicky,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I met Vicky.” His white teeth flashed in
a smile that sought to win her confidence. “That
young lady has a lot of sense. She wanted to know
why the trustees of the Virginia Dodson Fund were
not attending to business. So I’m here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Vicky oughtn’t to have done that.” Another
surge of colour, born of shame, swept into the
cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time Scot realized how very pretty she
was. He found her diffidence charming, for he lived
in a world where the women he knew could not afford
to be shy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vicky did just right,” he protested while he was
opening his sack. “Our baby must be well fed.
It’s my business to see to that, and I’m going to do it
from now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He built a fire while she watched him, the baby in
her arms. Mollie was acutely uncomfortable. The
gambler had taken off his coat in order that his movements
might be freer. In his figured waistcoat, frilled
cambric shirt, close-fitting trousers, and varnished
boots he looked too exquisite for menial labour. She
was acutely conscious of her patched and faded gingham.
It was Cophetua and the beggar maid brought
down to date, except that she was a wife and not a
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish—you wouldn’t,” she stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood up, masterful and dominant. His
glance swept round and found a battered water
bucket. “Where’s the spring, Mrs. Dodson?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go,” she begged. “It’s—it’s quite a
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m feeling better to-day. Maybe I can make it
to the spring and back,” he said, smiling. “Which
way, please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reluctantly she pointed to the spring. It was in
an arroyo nearly a quarter of a mile distant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Robert forgot to get water before he left. He’s—away
looking for work,” she explained with a slight
tremor of the lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He liked her better for the little lie. Scot guessed
that Dodson had not been at the camp for several
days. He had seen the man in town yesterday
drunk, and again to-day sleeping under an empty
wagon in a vacant lot. It was a safe bet that Mollie
Dodson carried the water for the family use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot returned with the water and made a batch
of biscuits and some hot coffee. While she ate he
put rice on to boil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he looked at her he saw tears in her brown
eyes. She was choking over the food and trying to
prevent him from seeing it. He decided that this
was a time for plain talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon I can guess how you feel,” he said gently.
“But that’s not the right angle to look at this thing.
Back where you come from persons that take help
from others are—well, they don’t hold their heads
up. But this is the West, a new country. The
camp’s short of food. It can’t be bought in the
market unless you know the ropes. We share with
each other here. In a kind of way we’re all one big
family. I’m your big brother, and I’m certainly
going to see this baby is fed proper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She murmured something he could not catch for
the break in her voice. He bustled about the fire
cheerfully and let her alone till she had regained
control of herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By which time Hugh and Vicky arrived, that long-legged
young lady skipping on the hilltops, with
high-pitched voluble comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looky. Looky here, Sister Mollie, what I got,”
she cried in her eager breathless fashion. “He got
it for me, Mister—Mister Santa Claus.” One
finger pointed straight at Hugh while she held out
for the inspection of her sister a doll with blue eyes
and flaxen hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but you shouldn’t—you ought not,” Mollie
protested to the boy. “Did she ask you for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am. I wanted to get it for her. It was
the only doll for sale in Virginia, far as I know. I
been hankerin’ to buy that doll. Now I feel a heap
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky herself was so clearly in a seventh heaven of
delight that her sister had not the heart to say anything
more about it. But she was uneasy in her
mind. She wondered if their obligations to these
young men would never end. What would Rob
say? How would he make her pay for the charity
he had forced her to accept?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the days that followed she had occasion many
times to feel weighted by the kindnesses of Scot
McClintock. Hugh had departed to report for
duty with the express company, but his brother made
it a point to see that the little family in the prairie
schooner did not lack for food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hunted the cañons and brought back a young
buck deer with him. One hind quarter of it went to
Mollie Dodson to keep the pot boiling. Fish, rabbits,
a prairie hen, three dozen eggs brought by a
rancher all the way from Honey Lake Valley; these
and other delicacies were forced upon the protesting
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert Dodson’s attitude was one of sneering
suspicion. He was willing that another man should
supply his family with the food it needed, but he
was mean enough to jeer at his wife and bully her
because of it. Even while he ate the meat brought
by McClintock his tongue was a whip that lashed
Mollie and the man. His whole attitude implied
that the two were carrying on a clandestine love
affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie wept herself to sleep more nights than one.
By nature a dependent woman, she did not now know
which way to turn. Her husband was a broken reed.
He no longer even pretended to be looking for work.
Humiliating though it was, she had to accept Scot’s
favours. She could not let the family starve. A
thousand times Robert Dodson had trampled her
pride and affection in the dust. She knew that life
with him held nothing for her, but it must go on
through the long gray years that stretched ahead
till the end of things. She was not the sort of
woman to contemplate suicide with any fortitude.
Both the courage and the cowardice for it she lacked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot returned from the Dodson camp one day,
lips close set and eyes dangerously lit with a smouldering
fire. Mollie was nursing a black eye. She
had fallen, she told him, against the corner of the
wagon. He had not believed her when she told this
tremulous lie. But Vicky had settled the matter
past doubt. She was waiting for him in a little
gulch near the camp, waiting to tell him in a burst of
impotent childish passion that Dodson had beaten
Mollie because she did not have supper ready for
him when he came home hours after the fire was
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As it chanced, McClintock met the ne’er-do-well
a hundred yards farther down the gulch. Dodson
was, for a wonder, sober. He had no money of his
own and he had been unable to wheedle many free
drinks from miners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At sight of the gambler Dodson scowled. He
had plenty of reasons for disliking Scot. He nursed
a continuous spleen because he would not let him
get at the money collected for the baby. His pride
suffered at accepting favours from a man who
scorned him. He was jealous of the interest McClintock
must have aroused in his “woman,” Mollie
Dodson. No matter how he stormed and sneered
at her he could not keep her mind from a comparison
of the men who just now were most present in her
life, and in that silent judgment he knew he must
play a sorry part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bummer, to use the phrase of the day, would
have passed without speaking. A sulky dignity
was the rôle he judged the most effective. But
Scot caught him by the coat lapel and swung him
sharply round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to teach you not to lay a hand on—on
a woman,” McClintock said, his voice thick
with suppressed passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dodson’s thin mask of offended dignity fell away
instantly. He tried to back off, snarling at the man
whose steel grip held him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s been tellin’ lies on me, has she?” he retorted,
showing his teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Dodson says she fell against the wagon.
I don’t believe it. You struck her, you yellow wolf.
Right now I’m going to give you the thrashing of
your life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of the loafer flashed fear. “You lemme
go,” he panted, trying to break away. “Don’t you
dass touch me. Think I don’t know about you an’
her? Think I’m a plumb idjit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An open-handed smash across the mouth stopped
his words. He made a swift pass with his right
hand. Scot’s left shot out and caught the wrist,
twisting it back and up. A bullet was flung into
the sky; then, under the urge of a pain which leaped
from wrist to shoulder of the tortured arm, the
revolver dropped harmlessly to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goddlemighty, you’re breakin’ my arm,” Dodson
shrieked, sagging at the knees as he gave to the
pressure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot sent home a stiff right. “You’ll be nursing
a black eye from that to-morrow,” he said evenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The craven in Dodson came out at once. He
tried to escape punishment by whining and begging.
He promised anything the other man might demand
of him. He made an attempt to fling himself to
the ground and cover up. McClintock set his teeth
and went through with the job.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afterwards to the bully who lay on the sand
sobbing with rage and pain, he gave curt orders.
“You’ll go back to town and not show up at the
wagon to-night. To-morrow you’ll tell Mrs. Dodson
you had a fight. You’ll not tell her who with or
what it was about. If you ever lay a hand on her
again or on Vicky, I’ll break every bone in your
body. Understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beaten man gulped out what might be taken
for an assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot turned away, sick at heart. Already he
questioned the wisdom of what he had done.</p>

<h3>SCOT OFFERS HEALTH HINTS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span> Washoe</span> zephyr was playing impish tricks
in Virginia City. It screamed down the side
of Mt. Davidson in a gale of laughter,
filling the air with the white powder of alkali dust.
It snatched hats from unwary heads and sent them
flying into the cleft cañon below which led through
the hills to the sage desert. It swooped up a dog
on A Street and dropped the yelping cur down the
chimney of a shack on B Street. Boards were
ripped from fences and sucked straight into the air
for fifty feet. A basket of duck eggs took premature
flight from a farmer’s wagon, sailed through the
window of a barber shop, and gave a customer in the
chair a free egg shampoo. The wind came in ribald
gusts, tremendous, filled with jeering howls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About Virginia City there have been many disputes,
but nobody who lived there in the ’sixties
ever denied that it was the windiest spot on earth.
The town slanted like a steep roof, each street a
terrace. During the zephyrs all sorts of possessions
came rolling downhill like tumbleweeds. They
ranged in size from a spool of thread to the roof of
a house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot McClintock, working his way along B Street,
took refuge in a hurdy-gurdy<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a> near Union. The
noise of a piano, of fiddles, of stamping feet, filled
the hall. The place was flooded with light from kerosene
lamps set in candelabras with crystal pendants.
At one side of the room was the inevitable bar.</p>

An unusual feature of Virginia City was the hurdy-gurdy house. In the
early days it was quite respectable, at least from the Western point of
view. The girls were generally Germans. Their business was to dance
with the miners and to lead them afterwards to the bar for a drink. Most
of the girls saved their money to send home to their parents overseas.
Serious-minded young women, they often married well and happily.
Later, these houses degenerated.—W. M. R.</p>

</div>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>A blonde young woman of Teutonic descent joined
Scot. “Would you like to dance, Mr. McClintock?”
she asked deferentially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not to-night, thank you,” he answered with the
grave respect he gave all women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His glance swept the hall, was arrested at a small
group near the farther end of the bar. The central
figure of it was a huge rough-bearded man with long
hair flowing to his shoulders. He wore an army
overcoat, dusty boots, and Mexican spurs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s eyes gave a signal of alarm. She had
forgotten for the moment about the affair between
the McClintocks and Sam Dutch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First time he’s been down,” she whispered.
“He has not yet seen you already. If you like—the
door——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot smiled grimly. He had a picture of himself
slipping out of the door to avoid Sam Dutch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was his temperament always to take the bull
by the horns. He stepped across the dance
floor to the bar, and stood at the elbow of the
desperado.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch, clinking glasses with a girl, looked round
to see his enemy before him. He was taken at a
disadvantage. Was this a trap set for him? If
he made a move would the younger McClintock
or some other ally of the gambler fill him full of slugs?
Nervously his eyes stole round the big room. They
came back to the clean, straight figure standing in
front of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No place for you, Dutch,” the faro dealer said
curtly. “Not good for your health. You’ve got
a weak heart, you know. It’s likely to stop working
altogether if you’re not careful of yourself. Go home—now—right
away—and stay there till the stage
leaves. This is an unhealthy altitude for you. Try
Aurora or Dayton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bad man moistened his dry lips with his
tongue. Tiny beads of moisture stood out on his
forehead. He had come to the parting of the ways
and knew it. If he let this man drive him from the
house he could never hold up his head in Virginia
again. His reign as chief would be ended here.
Should he take a chance and draw? He had killed
many men. This gambler, so far as he knew, had
never got one. Why not now? This very instant.
It would all be over in a flash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet—he could not do it. With McClintock’s
cold and steely stare in his he could not drop the
glass from his hand and reach for a revolver. The
wills of the two clashed, fought out the battle, and
the stronger won.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gaze of the killer fell away and slid round
the hall in a furtive search for help. It found none.
He was playing a lone hand. The way out must be
one of his own choosing. Of all these men and
women who watched this crisis so tensely not one
but would be glad to see him blotted out of existence.
His hand was against every man’s. That was the
penalty he paid for his reputation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again his tongue went out to moisten dry lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I reckon you’re right,” he heard himself say
huskily. “I ain’t feelin’ good yet. Fact is, I’m
still a sick man. Mebbe I better go home. I was
thinkin’ thataway myself before you came in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep right on thinking it. Think yourself out of
Virginia inside of twenty-four hours,” ordered Scot
implacably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch drained the glass and put it down shakily
on the bar. He laughed with attempted bravado
and swaggered to the door. There he turned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meet up with you again one o’ these days, Mr.
McClintock,” he said, his voice and manner a threat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot said nothing. Not for an instant did his
unwavering eyes release the man till the door had
shut behind him. Then, quickly, disregarding the
hands of congratulation thrust at him, he pushed
through the crowd and passed from the rear of the
building. He had no intention of letting himself
be a target for a shot through the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The discredited killer did not leave by stage. He
went out in a private buckboard to Carson, from
whence he drifted to the new camp Aurora, already
the largest town in that section of Nevada. His
self-esteem and public repute, shaken by the showdown
in the hurdy-gurdy house, were shortly restored
by a rencontre with another bad man. He shot his
victim in the stomach while they were drinking
together, after which he was cock of the walk at
Aurora.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch9'>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<h3>SCOT TALKS ON MOTHER LOVE</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he</span> weeks passed, became months. Spring
browned to summer and summer crisped to
autumn. Hugh and Scot saw nothing of each
other. The younger brother had given up riding and
joined a gold rush to a new camp; the older was still
dealing faro at the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dodsons were yet camped on the outskirts
of Virginia. The man of the family spent most of
his time hanging around saloons and dance halls.
Rarely he did a day’s work. Usually he secured
food and drink for himself by acting as janitor at
some of the places which he frequented. For weeks
at a time his wife never saw him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot McClintock no longer visited the dugout
beside the prairie schooner. The last time he had
seen Mollie Dodson was the day when he had thrashed
the bully to whom she was married. He did his
kindnesses by proxy now. The missionary from
Buffalo, New York, Calvin Baird by name, was his
deputy in supplying the needs of the Dodson family.
Sometimes Vicky reported to him, but he saw very
little even of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, one day, Vicky came to him at the International
Hotel, where he lived, and sent up word
that she wanted to see him. Scot came down and
found the face of his little friend wan and tear-stained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong, Vicky?” he asked, slipping his arm
round her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She began to sob, and through her broken words
he gathered the story. Dodson had come home drunk
while his wife was getting a bucket of water, had
flung himself on the bed without seeing the baby,
and had fallen at once into heavy stertorous slumber.
When Mollie got back the child was dead, smothered
by her own father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot borrowed a horse and rode out at once to
the camp. Dodson had temporarily disappeared,
frightened at the horrible thing he had done. The
accident had taken place twelve hours earlier, and
the tears of the mother were for the moment spent.
She was dry-eyed and wan, in that deep despair
which is beyond expression, almost beyond feeling.
With a tenderness that set flowing in Scot a wild river
of sympathy she drew back the cotton handkerchief
that covered the baby face. For an instant his
heart beat fast. Except for the pallor Virginia
looked so natural she might have been asleep. He
half-expected to see the lashes tremble and the blue
eyes open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock took on himself all the arrangements
for the funeral. He dragged Dodson out of a grog
shop, soused his head in a horse trough, and when
he became sober saw that he remained so until the
burial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day after the interment Scot called on Mrs.
Dodson. Her husband was not at the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he came plump to the purpose of his
visit. He was never a spendthrift of words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you and Vicky going to do?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” the bereaved mother answered
listlessly. “Vicky ought not to stay here. It’s
not right. But I’ve no place to send her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Stewart and I have discussed that. We’ve
talked with some of the business men of the town.
If you’re willing we’ll divert the baby’s fund to
Vicky and send her down to Miss Clapp’s school at
Carson. She’ll be well taken care of there. Miss
Clapp is a fine woman. Does it seem to you a good
idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears brimmed to her eyes. “You’re good. I
can never repay you. I—I’ll be awf’lly lonesome
without her, but if you think it best——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not what I think but what you think,” he
said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could I see her sometimes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As often as you like. She would spend her
vacations with you, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lump in her throat began to ache again. Her
gaze travelled beyond the cañon below, across the
Twenty-Six Mile Desert and the Forty Mile Desert
to the Pine Nut Mountains. There it rested for a
long time. She drew in her breath with a deep
ragged sigh that was almost a sob. “She’d better
go. This is no life for a little girl. I want her to
have a chance to—to—be happy and live with good
people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it any life for a young woman to lead?” he
asked, his blue eyes fixed steadily on her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint flag of colour fluttered in her wan cheeks.
He had never before broken down the outposts of her
reserve. She felt her pulse beating. His impersonal
friendliness had suddenly become a close and vital
thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why speak of that? I made my choice years
ago,” she said. She thought, but did not say, that
the hard and bitter facts of existence cannot be talked
away. They are as immovable as the Sierras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have to make fresh choices every day,” he
told her. “Do you think your life can go on now
the same as it did before? It can’t. There’s a
gulf between you and—him. Have you any hope
that it can be bridged?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or that you can do him any good by staying with
him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why should you make deliberate shipwreck
of your life—or let him do it for you? Just
now you don’t care what becomes of you. But
you have to keep on the best you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke quietly, his words unstressed, but just
for a flash she caught in his eyes an expression that
told her his emotions were a banked volcano. Mollie
found herself trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no. I married him, for better or worse.
I’ll stay with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you stay with him when he doesn’t want you,
when he won’t stay with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps he’ll change,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knuckles of his clenched hand were bloodless,
she noticed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men of his age don’t change. They’re what they
have made themselves. They can’t be anything
else. Would you waste your life on such an impossible
chance? Don’t do it. Begin again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s work at Virginia for a hundred women.
You can mend clothes or cook or keep boarders—anything
for a start. Afterwards——” He let the
future take care of itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of her dependence Mollie had a capacity
for dumb resistance. Scot left her knowing that
he had the empty victory of having convinced her
judgment but not the deep instinct in her born of
habit and tradition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked down the grade past dugouts, shanties,
and lean-tos. Occasionally he could hear the blast
of dynamite. He passed bull teams hauling hay
from the Truckee Meadows, the drivers cracking
long-lashed whips with short hickory handles.
Freight outfits, wood haulers, and ore wagons filled
the road. Everywhere was the bustle and activity
that go with the early years of a new and prosperous
mining camp. He was aware of it all only subconsciously,
for his mind was filled with thoughts
of the woman he had just left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A medley of voices, a whirl of excited men, roused
him from reflection as he reached the end of the
business part of town. Just now he was not looking
for crowds. He turned to make the climb to A
Street when a voice hailed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just in time, Scot. We’re aimin’ to hang Dodson.
Come on, old scout.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock stood rooted. Here was an easy way
for Mollie out of her troubles. All he had to do
was to keep on walking up hill and the matter would
settle itself. It was none of his business. If Virginia
City had had enough of the ne’er-do-well the
matter was one for it to pass upon. The fellow was
not worth a short bit anyhow. Scot’s judgment was
that he was better dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None the less he found it impossible to keep on up
the hill. He walked toward the mob and pushed
a way through with his broad shoulders to the cowering
wretch with the rope around his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dodson sank down and clung to McClintock’s
knees. “Save me,” he begged, his face ashen
gray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s he done?” asked Scot of the man who
seemed to be the leader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what the drunken bummer did—killed
his own baby. Then when Jerry Mulligan
told him what for an hour ago he stuck a knife in
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Jerry dead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Not yet. Doc says maybe he’ll die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerry have a six-shooter out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was gonna attack me. It was self-defence,”
the grovelling man pleaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the crowd spoke: “This Dodson’s bad—bad
clear to the bottom of his heart. He’s been talkin’
about his wife to make excuses for what he did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s wait, boys,” Scot said. “Maybe Jerry
will pull through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, let’s finish the job, Scot. This fellow’s no
good, anyhow. You know it. So do we.” Jean
Poulette, the owner of a gambling house, pushed to
the front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not thinking about him, Jean. I’m thinking
about that little mother in the prairie schooner.
She’s got trouble enough already, hasn’t she? Do
you want to pile on more—to send her through life
marked as the wife of a man that was hanged? Ain’t
that rather rough on her, boys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll be well rid of him,” a voice cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” agreed McClintock. “But not that way.
I don’t say this drunken loafer is worth saving.
But we can’t hang him without striking a blow at her.
She’s sensitive, boys. It would hurt her ’way down
deep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sho! Tha’s foolishness, Scot. It’d be a li’l
shock at first maybe, but afterwards she’d just
naturally be plumb pleased. Any of us would in
her place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, who started this gabfest?” demanded the
man holding the other end of the rope that had been
slipped over Dodson’s head. “Let’s hustle this job
through. I got a man to meet right soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock met him eye to eye. “You can go
meet him right now, Six-Fingered Pete. The hanging’s
off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who says it’s off?” blustered Pete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say so.” Scot spoke quietly, his voice low and
clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Someone elect you judge and jury, Scot?” asked
Poulette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry to interfere, boys. I’ve just come in from
seeing Mrs. Dodson. She’s all broke up about the
baby. You wouldn’t want to make things harder
for her. It doesn’t matter a billy-be-damn whether
this fellow lives or dies. Nobody cares about him.
He’s nothing. We’ll hold him till we see how Jerry
comes out—just stick him in the calaboose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Scot was a dominating figure in the life of the
camp it was not because men walked in fear of him.
He never looked for trouble or avoided it. He never
used his splendid strength and courage to bully those
weaker than himself. Even old Tom Todd, the
Negro roustabout who was the butt of the camp
jokes, always met with respect from the dealer at the
Crystal. His influence was born of liking and admiration.
It maintained itself without effort on his
part because he had the qualities of leadership.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a part of his gift that he made men want
to follow the path he took. He usually knew exactly
in what direction he wanted to go, but he never
hectored or was overbearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poulette felt within himself a response to Scot’s
warm appealing smile, but he was ashamed to make
a direct face about. “Might as well go through now.
You can’t ever do justice without hurtin’ some
woman somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ this bummer ce’tainly is ripe for a rope,”
added Pete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t lift a hand for him,” Scot answered.
“I’m still thinking of that mother’s aching heart,
boys. Not one of us here was ever good enough
to his mother. We’re a hard, tough lot. We’ve
travelled a heap of crooked trails since we were kids
at our mothers’ knees. Pete, you hard-boiled old
sinner, I met your mother in Sacramento last year,
and that little lady began to tell me about what a
good boy you’ve always been to her, how you send
her money now, and how when you were a freckled
runt of a ten-year-old——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Red as a beet, Pete interrupted roughly: “Oh,
hire a hall, Scot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock pushed his advantage home. The
theme of his talk was mother love. These big,
overgrown boys reacted to it because each one of
them had enshrined in his own heart the memory
of a mother he had many times hurt and often
neglected. The point Scot made was that they could
now pay part of the debt they owed their own
mothers. It scored heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon Scot’s right,” someone spoke up. “If
it’s gonna worry the lady any, might as well postpone
the necktie party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mobs are fickle and unstable of purpose. This
one’s mind began to veer. Inside of five minutes
Scot had the members of the lynching party moulded
to his view. They had no desire whatever to hang
the poltroon who had stabbed their friend, or, at
least, the desire was subordinated to a more imperative
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rescued man tried to whine out a blend of
thanks and justification to the gambler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot looked him over scornfully and turned on
his heel without a word.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch10'>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<h3>TILL TAPPING</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he</span> loyalty Mollie had cherished to her early
ideal of marriage burned low for lack of fuel
to feed upon. Her husband had practically
deserted her. When he returned to camp it was to
bully money out of her or to get some of their small
store of belongings to sell. In the intervals she
might starve for all he cared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a day when she definitely broke with
her past life. She moved into town and opened a
small shop where she sold home-cooked food to
miners eager to buy her cakes, cookies, pies, and
doughnuts. She called her place the Back Home
Kitchen, and she did a thriving business. The
members of the fire companies patronized the store
a great deal, and since they ran to a large extent
the political and social life of Virginia City, as they
had done in San Francisco a few years earlier, her
shop became so much the vogue that she had to employ
a Chinese assistant to help with the cooking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot watched the venture but offered no advice.
He had, in fact, not spoken to Mollie since the day
after the funeral. Vicky had been taken to Carson
by Hank Monk on the stage and was writing back
badly spelled but enthusiastic letters to her sister.
The cards had been re-shuffled, McClintock told
himself, and he was no longer sitting in at the game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, the new camps of Nevada went their
humorous, turbulent, and homicidal way. Men grew
wild over prospects that never had a chance to
become real mines. They worked on croppings,
sold and bought feet in a thousand prospects, struck
it rich, went stony broke again within the month.
They were in bonanza or in borrasca<a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a>, and in either
case kept their grins working. They lived in brush
tents, sack tents, or dugouts, and the hard conditions
never disturbed their happy-go-lucky optimism.</p>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<div class='footnote'>
<p class='footnote'>
<span class='footnote-id' id='f8'><a href='#r8'>[8]</a></span>

The Mexicans used to say that a mine was in bonanza when its production
was high, and in borrasca before the vein was struck or after it had
pinched out. With the adoption of the terms by Americans, the words
took on a more general application. A bonanza was then any highly
profitable venture; a borrasca was the reverse.—W. M. R.</p>

</div>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>They shared their last pot of beans with a stranger
and were gaily confident that to-morrow they would
strike a pick into the glory hole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The saving grace of American humour salted all
their adventures. The law in particular, when it
made its belated appearance, was a merry jest.
Those who dispensed it and those who dispensed
with it enjoyed the joke alike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two women in Carson quarrelled over a cow.
One accused the other of milking it secretly. The
jury decided that the defendant was guilty of milking
the cow in the second degree. A man in Virginia
City was haled before the court charged with drunkenness,
which in Nevada was held to be a right
guaranteed a man by the Constitution. The constable
Mike whispered to the justice that the arrested
man had one hundred dollars on his person.
“Are youse guilty?” the judge demanded. The
defendant said he was not. “You know domn
well yez are. I fine yez a hundred dollars, fifty
for me an’ fifty for Mike,” the Court passed judgment.
Sometimes the laugh was on the Court, as
in the case of a justice, very hazy as to his powers
and duties, who conducted the preliminary hearing
of a man charged with murder. He listened to the
evidence till he was satisfied, then announced his
decision. “I find you guilty and sentence you to
be hanged at ten o’clock to-morrow. The constable
will bring the prisoner and a rope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the homicidal mania of those who lived by
their wits had its momentary gleams of dreadful
humour. Scot drifted into a barber shop one day
and found El Dorado Johnnie having his hair curled.
The youth in the chair was dressed in new clothes.
His boots had been polished. He was shaved and
perfumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to your wedding, Johnnie?” the faro dealer
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir,” replied the other. “ ‘Farmer’ Peel has
give out that he’s gunnin’ for me. If I’m elected
as the corpse I want to look nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It turned out that Johnnie’s forethought was wise.
“Farmer” Peel shot quicker and straighter than he
did. Peel, who had come from Salt Lake with a
record of several killings, was arrested for having made
a disturbance. He was fined and released on his
own recognizance to go and raise the money. “Farmer”
Peel sober was a pleasant, mild young fellow
who wanted to be at peace with the world, but
Peel drunk was a demon. Before he raised the
money to pay his fine, he visited several saloons and
had a change of heart. Back he went to the court,
caught the justice by the beard, and mopped that
dignitary all over the floor. Nobody intervened,
for the drunken man was dangerous. The justice,
released at last, had to be removed to the hospital
for repairs. Virginia City merely grinned. Judge
or no judge, every man had to play his own hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Offences against property were considered more
serious than those against life. In some camps
hired desperadoes jumped claims. Hold-ups were
of frequent occurrence, and every few days a stage
robbery was reported. Nevada was too busy developing
the newly discovered ore veins to pay much
attention to these excrescences from the normal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this rough, crude society Mollie moved with as
much safety as she could have done in a staid New
England village. No ruffian could have molested
her without the danger of being lynched. The only
man who annoyed her was the one whose name
she bore. When he discovered how well she was
doing financially Dodson began to hang around the
Back Home to bleed its mistress of what she earned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie was an easy victim. She never had been
one to stand up for her own rights. She fought
only feebly and without success to protect herself.
Every day or two Dodson robbed the till.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He boasted of it to his cronies when he was half
seas over. To Scot, who was keeping an eye on him
in expectation of just such a possibility, the news
was promptly carried. He learned that the man
paid his visits to the Back Home in the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days later Dodson knocked at the door of
the shop and was admitted. He slouched forward
to the counter and leered at the girl he had promised
to love and protect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come through, old woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t. There’s just enough for the rent,” she
pleaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re holdin’ out on me. Tha’s what you’re
doin’. I won’t stand it—not a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes were glazed. He thrust his bullet head
forward threateningly. Mollie recognized the signs
of the abusive stage of intoxication. Presently he
would begin to beat her if she opposed him. But
she was desperate. She could not let him take the
rent money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t have it. That’s all there’s to it. You
just can’t have it,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie flew to the till as the man came round the
counter. She was between him and the money.
He tried to thrust her to one side, but the space
was narrow. For a few seconds he tugged at her
in vain. Then his temper leaped out. He struck
her again and again while she tried to shield herself
from the blows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither of them heard the door open or saw a
man step into the room. Neither of them saw
him take the counter in one flying leap. An arm
reached out and plucked Dodson from his victim.
It hurled him back against the wall, where he struck
with great force, hung for a moment, and dropped
limply to the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie lifted her eyes to those of Scot McClintock
and into the white face came two flaming flowers.
For in the eyes that burned down into hers she read
that which brought a burst of music into her heart.
She had fought against this—oh, how she had
schooled herself to deny it! But with his strong
arms round her, his heart beating against her own,
what was the use of pretending any longer? Her
supple body made a little motion of nestling closer.
She began to sob quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He—he——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot brushed her explanation aside. “Forget
him. He’s out of your life. It’s you and I now.
I kept away. I gave him his chance. I gave you
yours to go it alone. That’s ended. I’m going to
take care of you now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lifted her flushed face and kissed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That kiss stirred to life all the Puritan blood of
Mollie, the racial inheritance from a rock-ribbed
ancestry. She pushed him from her with all the
force of a despairing energy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no!” she cried, and
fled to the room back of the shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was afraid of his passionate tenderness for
her, but she was afraid, too, of the deep yearning of
her whole being for the love he offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the days that followed Scot McClintock fought
the fight of his life. He had always prided himself
that he was master of his desires. When he yielded
to self-indulgence it was because he chose to follow
for a time the path of dalliance. But this keen-edged
longing for the woman he loved flooded his
being, swept over him like great waves over a bather
in the surf. It set him fifty times pacing the floor,
to and fro, to and fro. For the first time in his life
he learned that he had nerves. There was a passionate
urge in him to take what he wanted. He
could make her happy in spite of all the tongues
that would clack, in spite of cynical smiles and hard
unforgiveness on the part of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But could he? Would his love be enough to insure
Mollie’s happiness if he overbore her scruples? He
knew it would not. There was in her a something
fine and flowerlike that blossomed shyly through all
the sordid impedimenta of her life. If he snatched
at her, as a child does at a rose, the fragrant beauty
of her would be crushed and lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Scot knew that it was the best of him that
wanted her. This was the real thing that had come
to him at last. Love had penetrated the folly and
waste of his life. Its rapier thrust had pushed
through the conceits of manner and dress in which he
had wrapped himself. It called to the simple elemental
manhood in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew how his world would take it if he eloped
with Mollie. His old father, Alexander McClintock,
a Bible-reading Presbyterian of granitic faith, would
cast him off with a gesture worthy of the ancient
prophets. Hugh would be hurt and shocked, but
he would not give him up. Virginia City would
be interested but not outraged, for the town had
by this time become accustomed to unexpected
shifts in marital relations. The legal divorce had
not yet reached Nevada, but a simple substitute for
it was not infrequent. Many young women who had
come from the East by way of the Overland Trail
had found the long desert trip destructive of romance
and had deserted their rough and weatherworn
husbands for more devoted and attractive lovers.
In Mollie’s case the camp would find extenuating
circumstances. Dodson was a ne’er-do-well of a
particularly despicable type. He was a shiftless,
wife-beating drunkard. It had not been his fault
that Jerry Mulligan had persisted in recovering
from the knife thrust in his side. Moreover, Scot
was known to be no Lothario. The general verdict
would be that it was nobody’s affair but that of the
principals. If Dodson felt aggrieved he could always
appeal to Judge Colt as a court of last resort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, but Scot had to think of Mollie herself—of
Mollie into whose cheeks he could send the delicate
colour flying, whose pulses he could set beating with
a burst of music in her heart. The thought of her
drenched him with despair. How could he protect
her if he remained a stranger in her life? Yet if he
broke the code with her he would be saving her from
distress only to plunge her into greater trouble.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch11'>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<h3>“TWENTY-FOUR HOURS TO GET OUT”</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>ugh</span> wrote Scot from Aurora, where the
boy was filling a wood contract. He proposed
that Scot join him in the new camp.
The older brother declined. He could not leave
the neighbourhood of Mollie till he was assured she
had the strength to manage her own affairs. He had
once told her he meant to be her big brother. At least
he could be that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aurora was a gold camp in the first flush of its
prosperity. The town was built in a gulch, below
which lie narrow, crooked cañons. The history
of the camp, in its essential aspects, parallels that
of a dozen others. Its first inhabitants were hard-working
prospectors, prosaic grubbers who respected
each other’s rights and lent a kindly hand to the
neighbour in the next-door tent. But after the
“glory hole” was struck and the population began
to climb came an influx of parasites—gamblers,
desperadoes, and road agents. A small percentage
of the population, they leavened the whole. Down
Virgin Cañon, by stage or on horseback, came John
Daily, James Masterson, Sam Dutch, William
Buckley, and John McDowell, alias Three-Fingered
Jack. They were the advance guard of a hundred
others of like mind, hard-visaged “man eaters”
whose trigger fingers always itched. They made
Aurora sit up on its hind legs and howl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two rival gangs operated, one from San Francisco,
the other from Sacramento. Between them they
ran the town. There was a reign of lawlessness.
Juries were afraid to convict. Judges and sheriffs
were timid about pushing cases. Sam Dutch, king
of the killers, boasted that he was chief. He was
suspicious of everybody and never sat except with
his back to a wall. In the evening he always saw
that the curtains were down. He was for ever
watching for the inevitable hour when some other
bad man would challenge his supremacy and perhaps
cut short his career. This suspense increased his
deadliness. He could not afford to wait for an even
break because he could not fathom an opponent’s
mind and know just when he might elect to draw
steel. Wherefore, like the rest of his kind, he killed
unnecessarily without provocation. His theory was
that dead men are harmless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Hugh knew that Dutch was in town he
prepared for the trouble he foresaw. Every day
he practised with his navy revolver when he was up
in the hills with his woodchoppers. Every night in
his cabin he carefully oiled and loaded the weapon.
He, too, improvised curtains of gunny sacks for the
window. When he went down Main Street he had
eyes in the back of his head. For he knew that
Dutch would assassinate him if possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Winter hangs on long at Aurora. There is no
spring. The dry, torrid summer with its parching
heat follows on the heels of frost. When Hugh
arrived in June the cañons still held banked the
winter snow. By the middle of July the gulch
was a bakeshop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late afternoon one sultry day when Hugh
walked down the crooked business street of the town.
He stopped in the shadow cast by the false front
of a store.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dog up Virgin Gulch was howling monotonously.
A long, lank man, carelessly dressed, sat in a chair
tilted back against the wall. One of his heels was
hooked in a rung of the chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I owned a half-interest in that dog,” he drawled
lazily, “I believe I’d kill my half.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh grinned and looked at the man. He had
yellow hair, a great mop of it, and twinkling eyes
heavily thatched by overhanging brows. He learned
later that the man’s name was Sam Clemens. The
world came to know him better as Mark Twain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bearded miner who had come out of the store
gave the remark his attention. “You couldn’t do
that, Sam,” he said at length. “If you did that,
don’t you see you’d kill the whole dog?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clemens looked at the miner. “Maybe you’re
right. Anyhow, the other half would be too sick
to howl,” he said hopefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you owned the tail you could cut that off.
Or if you owned one of the ears, say,” explained the
man with the beard. “I don’t reckon your pardner
could kick on that. But if you killed half the dog
the rest of it would sure die. Any one can see
that, Sam. You sure made a fool remark that
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I can see now you’re right,” the lank man
agreed. “I must be out of my head. Probably the
altitude.”<a id='r9'/><a href='#f9' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[9]</span></sup></a></p>

<span class='footnote-id' id='f9'><a href='#r9'>[9]</a></span>

Mark Twain afterwards made use of this in one of his books. A good
many bits of his humour can be traced to the days when he was a youth
in Nevada.—W. M. R.</p>

</div>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>“O’ course you could buy the other fellow’s interest
in the dog and then kill it,” pursued the literal-minded
one. “No objection to that, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I could do that—if someone would lend me
the money. But I wouldn’t, come to think of it.”
Clemens brightened up till he was almost cheerful.
“I’d give the dog to you, Hank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Attracted by the lank stranger’s dry humour,
Hugh reached for a three-cornered stool and started
to sit down. He changed his mind abruptly. Out
of a saloon next door, named the Glory Hole from
Aurora’s famous treasure lode, a big bearded man
in an army coat came slouching. It was the first
time Hugh had seen Sam Dutch since their meeting
at the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy stood, slightly crouched, his right thumb
hitched lightly in the pocket of his trousers. Every
nerve was taut as a fiddle string. The eyes of
McClintock, grown hard as quartz, did not waver a
hair’s breadth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch stood in front of the saloon a moment,
uncertain which way to turn. He came toward
the little group before the store. Apparently he
was in arrears of sleep, for a cavernous yawn spread
over and wrinkled his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yawn came suddenly to a period and left the
man gaping, his mouth ludicrously open. Evidently
he was caught by complete surprise at sight of young
McClintock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You here!” he presently growled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh said nothing. There is strength in silence
when accompanied by a cold unwinking gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch made a mistake. He delivered an ultimatum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-four hours. I’ll give you twenty-four
hours to get out. If you’re here then——” The
threat needed no words to complete it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without lifting his eyes from the killer Hugh
sidestepped to the middle of the road. If bullets
began to fly he had no desire to endanger the bystanders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be here,” he said crisply. “If you feel that
way, no use waiting twenty-four hours. Come
a-shootin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock had no wish to start trouble. If he
had known that Dutch was coming out of the Glory
Hole he would have quietly absented himself. But
the other man had forced the issue. The boy knew
that any proposal to talk over the difficulty would
have been regarded as a sign of weakness and would
have precipitated an attack. Wherefore he had
flung out his bold challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chief of Main Street was startled. Some
months since, this boy had tossed a defiance in his
teeth. Before he had had time to draw a weapon
two bullets had crashed into him. The psychology
of a killer is peculiar. Down in the bottom of his
heart he is as full of superstitions as a gambler.
Dutch was no coward, though he fought like a wolf
outside of the code that governed more decent men.
But he was not used to men like the McClintocks.
Other men, when he raved and threatened, spoke
humbly and tried to wheedle him back to good humour.
In the very silence with which these two faced
him was something menacing and deadly that paralyzed
his fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now. Give you twenty-four hours,” the
big man snarled through his beard. He used the
fighting epithet, applying it to Scot McClintock.
“Like yore brother did me when I was feelin’ sick
an’ triflin’ an’ all stove up. Get out. Hit the
trail on the jump. Or I’ll sure collect you, kid or no
kid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re wasting time,” Hugh said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The killer raved. He cursed savagely. But he
did not draw his six-shooter. The man had his
crafty reasons. This youngster was chain lightning
on the shoot. The evidence of this was scarred on
the body of Dutch. Moreover, he could probably
take the boy at disadvantage later—get him from
behind or when he came into a room dazed from the
untempered light outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spitting his warning, Dutch backed into the
Glory Hole. “Not room for you’n me here both.
Twenty-four hours. You done heard me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red-shirted miner Hank turned beaming on
McClintock. He could appreciate this, though
Clemens’s humour was too much for him. “You
blamed li’l’ horn toad, if you didn’t call a bluff on
Dutch and make it stick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He used the same epithet that the desperado had
just employed, but as it fell from his lips the sting
of it was gone. A few years later a senator from the
sagebrush state had occasion to explain away this
expression on the floor of the upper house of Congress.
His version of it was that this was a term of endearment
in Nevada. Sometimes it was. Then, again,
sometimes it was not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh made no mistake. He had won the first
brush, but he knew the real battle was still to come.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch12'>CHAPTER XII</h1></div>

<h3>“GIT OUT DE WAY, OLE DAN TUCKER”</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>ugh</span> was no hero of romance, but a normal
American youth whose education from childhood
had fitted him to meet the emergencies
that might confront him. The school of the frontier
teaches self-reliance. Every man must stand alone.
He is judged by the way he assays after the acid
test of danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the Crystal Palace Hugh had not been conscious
of any fear. His brother’s life had depended upon
his coolness, the smooth efficiency with which his
nerves and muscles coördinated. Not until after the
peril was past had he felt any hysteria, and then only
because he thought he had killed a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The situation was different now. He had to meet
alone the most notorious man killer of Nevada,
not when he was strung up for action by the clash of
a sudden encounter, but after a day and night of
suspense in which his imagination would play him
unkind tricks and show him ghastly visions. He
saw pictures—horrible pictures in which Dutch
loomed up a huge apelike superman towering over
him as a prostrate victim. He saw himself playing
the poltroon, dying, dead, every detail of the scene
sharp as the lines of an etching. The little boy in
him—the child that had for years been dormant—crept
out and wailed with fear. Yet all the time
he wore a wooden face that told no tales to curious
men who watched him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When at last he was alone Hugh did the wisest
thing possible. He borrowed a page instinctively
from twentieth-century psychology not then in
vogue. He faced the fact that he was afraid, dragged
his fears out into the open, examined them, and
jeered at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s ailin’ you, Hugh McClintock?” he demanded
of himself. “Ain’t you got any sand in
yore craw a-tall? Who’s Sam Dutch, anyhow?
What if he has got a dozen men? Didn’t he kill
half of them when they weren’t lookin’ for trouble?
Didn’t he pick on four flushers who wouldn’t
stand the gaff? Say he is big as all outdoors.
Easier to hit, ain’t he? What do you care if he’s
a wild man from Borneo and chews glass, like he
claims? All men are the same size when they get
behind a Colt gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He oiled his revolver while he fought out his fears
aloud. “Whyfor should Sam Dutch hang the
Indian sign on you? He’s the same scalawag they
had to carry feet first outa the Crystal Palace after
you got through with him. He’s the same false
alarm Scot ran outa Virginia not so long ago. He
should do the frettin’, not you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the thought of Scot, courage flowed back
into his heart. He knew that somehow Scot would
in his place face this fellow down or blot him from
the map. “Trouble with you is you’re scared,
Hugh. But you’re goin’ through, ain’t you? Sure.
You got to. Then buck up an’ throw the scare into
the other fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mind stuck to that last thought. What were
his brains for if he could not make them more useful
than the craft and brutishness of Sam Dutch? His
mind began to work out a practical plan of action.
When he arose from the bench where he sat cleaning
the revolver his eyes were bright and shining. The
fear in him, which had for hours been lying like a
heavy weight on his subconscious mind, no longer
repressed but frankly admitted and examined, had
now vanished into thin air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as it was dark Hugh slipped out of his
shack and crept along the side of the gulch toward
Main Street. He stopped behind a cabin of whipsawed
lumber and edged forward to the back of it.
The hut had one room. Except the front door
there was no way of entrance but by one of the two
windows. Hugh had no intention of entering. He
was satisfied that Dutch would not come home
till late. Probably he would bring a companion
with him as a protection against the chance of being
ambushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For five minutes Hugh worked at one window,
then gave his attention to the other. After this
he stole back to the edge of the gulch and busied
himself among the branches of a little scrub tree
which stood at the point of intersection between a
small gorge and the main gulch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh’s guess had been a good one. It was close
to one o’clock in the morning when Dutch returned
to his cabin. With him was a companion whom
Hugh, lying huddled in the sage close to the cañon’s
rising slope, recognized as William Buckley, one of
Sam’s boon toadies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man killer took no chances, at least no more
than were necessary. It was quite on the cards,
as he understood the business of murder, that his
foe might lie in wait for him and shoot from ambush.
He did not come down the road, but by way of an
alley that brought him to the rear of his shanty.
Quickly and stealthily the two men dodged inside.
Once in, Dutch bolted the door and pulled the window
blinds. Before going to bed he moved both
cots so as to put them out of range of one who might
crawl up to either window and take a wild shot at
the place where one of the beds had been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch was slipping out of his long army coat when
there came a gentle tap—tap—tap at one of the
windows. The big bulk of a man stood crouched,
eyes glaring, head thrust forward, every sense alert
to meet the danger which threatened. He slid out
of the coat and dragged a revolver from his hip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again there came a slow tap—tap—tap, this time
on the opposite window. With incredible swiftness
Dutch whirled and fired. His gun was still smoking
when the tap—tap—tap, clear and measured,
sounded a second time at the first window. Straight
at the sound the killer flung another shot. He
rushed to the window and drew back the sack used
for a curtain. There was nobody at the window
either alive or dead, nor was it possible for anybody
to have slipped away in that second between the
sound of the tapping and the moment when Dutch
had torn aside the sack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he stood there, frightened and bewildered,
there came a sound that turned his flesh to goose-quills.
Down the wind was borne a sobbing scream
like the wail of a lost soul. Dutch knew that no
human voice had uttered that cry. It rose and fell,
died down, broke out again, weird and unearthly as
a banshee’s whimper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tiny beads of perspiration stood out on the man’s
forehead. His hands shook. He had no thought
but that his call from the world beyond had come,
and with the blood of a dozen men on his atrophied
conscience he yielded to the rising tide of terror in
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slow tap—tap—tap sounded a third time on
the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gun-fighter trembled. “Goddlemighty, Bill,
I—I done got my call.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Buckley felt none too comfortable himself, but he
managed a laugh. “Sho, Sam! Nothin’ but the
wind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wind can’t tap on the window for me, can
it? It can’t——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sentence died out, for a second time the
ululation of that sobbing shriek came faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch collapsed on a cot, covering his ears with his
hands. The man was of a low order of intelligence,
as full of superstition as a plantation Negro. His
mind did not even seek for a rational explanation
of the phenomena that startled him. He was a
coward of conscience. The clock was striking
twelve o’clock for him. He accepted that without
debate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With an uneasy glance at the window Buckley
offered such sorry comfort as he could. “The
wind plays damn queer tricks, Sam. You buck
up an’ get a bottle out. We’ll play seven up for a
spell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A high mocking laugh, thin and sinister, trembled
out of the night as though in answer to Buckley’s
suggestion. The two men looked at each other.
Each read fear in the eyes facing his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It—that sounded like—like Al Morford the
day I shot him,” gasped Dutch, clutching at his
companion’s sleeve. “He—he was laughin’ at me
when I drew on him and asked him where he’d have
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t want to get to thinkin’ about that
now, Sam,” advised Buckley, moistening his dry
lips with the tip of his tongue. “Let’s hit the grit
back to the Glory Hole. We’ll feel better once
we get outside of a few drinks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He—said he’d come back an’ ha’nt me,” whispered
the man killer abjectly. “Said it while they
was takin’ his boots off, right before he passed in
his checks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Al Morford’s been dead an’ buried for years,”
said the other man shakily. “Forget him. An’ le’s
get outa here, sudden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another wail soughed down from the gorge.
Dutch shook like an aspen. “I—I can’t go out—there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You gonna stay here all night? I ain’t.”
Buckley mopped the sweat from his forehead and
drew a revolver. He trod softly to the door, then
turned to his companion. “Come on, Sam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Buckley had no mind to take the night walk alone,
nor had Dutch the courage to stay without his ally.
The big ruffian, his nerves a-quiver, crept after the
other man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They slipped from the cabin toward the road.
A gust of wind swept the gulch, bringing with it
a menacing jangle of horrible laughter. The fugitives
threw away the remnant of their pride and stumbled
through the sagebrush at a run. Their hearts were
in their throats. When they looked back it was with
the expectation of seeing hobgoblins burst from
the chaparral in pursuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Hugh McClintock stole up to the cabin
and removed a tick-tack from each of the shattered
windows. He cut down from the scrub pine at the
mouth of the gorge a kind of æolian harp he had made
out of violin strings and a soap box. The wind,
whistling through this, had given out the weird wail
which had shaken the nerves of Dutch. The falsetto
laughter had been an histrionic effort of Hugh’s
own vocal cords. It happened that just now his
voice was changing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The youngster went home to bed and to sleep.
Meanwhile Dutch, to restore his weakened self-esteem
and courage, drank heavily through the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning Hugh made his few preparations.
He wrote a letter to his father and another to Scot.
He ate a good breakfast. He examined carefully
his revolver and a sawed-off shotgun loaded with
slugs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By way of back alleys he reached the Glory Hole
and slipped through the back entrance to a small
table in the darkest corner of the saloon. Except
for the bartender Hugh was almost alone in the place.
Two men, their feet on the rail, were discussing
the bonanza in Last Chance Hill. They were comparing
the merits of the Real Del Monte and the
Wide West, both of which mines were producing
very rich ore. Occasionally somebody else drifted in
and out again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bartender looked curiously at the young
fellow with the sawed-off shotgun on the table in front
of him. He was a little puzzled to know what to do.
He did not want to intrude in anybody’s private
affairs, but he did not want any trouble in the Glory
Hole. Perhaps this youngster was going hunting and
had agreed to meet someone here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attendant drifted that way on pretense of
wiping a table with a towel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Serve you anything?” he asked casually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Waitin’ for someone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I take care of the gun till yore friend gets
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. It’s no trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Live here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Wood contract for the Real Del Monte.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young stranger’s manner was so matter
of fact that the bartender’s suspicions, not very
strong, were lulled to rest. It was not likely, anyhow,
that this boy with the golden down on his cheeks
could be looking for trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came an irruption of patrons and the man
with the apron became busy. Then another group
swept into the place. There were five of them.
In the van was Dutch. Hugh recognized Buckley,
Daily, and Three-Fingered Jack. They took noisily
a table close to the one where Hugh sat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daily, about to sit down, gripped the back of his
chair hard and stared at the man behind the sawed-off
shotgun. He did not take his seat. Instead, out
of one corner of his mouth, he dropped a word of
warning to Dutch. Then, as though moved by a
careless impulse to speak to the bartender, he sauntered
to the front of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch slewed round his head and looked at Hugh.
Neither of them spoke a word. The killer was not
drunk. He was in that depressed state of mind
which follows heavy drinking after the stimulus
has died down. One glance was enough to make
clear to him his carelessness. By the crook of a
finger his foe could fill him full of buckshot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ticking of a clock behind the bar was the only
sound in the room. The gun-fighters with Dutch
dared not rise to slip out of the line of fire for fear
McClintock might misunderstand the movement
and blaze away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh broke the silence. “If any of you gentlemen
have business elsewhere Mr. Dutch and I will excuse
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All of them, it appeared, had matters needing
their attention. They moved swiftly and without
delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch begged for his life. His ugly face was a
yellowish-green from fear. “I was jes’ a-foolin’,
young fellow. I didn’t aim to hurt you none. Only
a li’l’ joke. Ole Sam don’t bear no grudge. Le’s
be friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man with the shotgun said nothing. With
the tip of his forefinger he tapped slowly three times
on the wooden top of the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bad man gave a low moan of terror. He had
no thought but that he had come to the end of the
passage. His brain was too paralyzed to permit him
to try to draw his revolver. Nemesis was facing
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hands on the table,” ordered Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big hands trembled up and fell there. Abjectly
Dutch pleaded for the mercy he had never
given another man. He would leave camp. He
would go to Mexico. He would quit carrying a gun.
Any terms demanded he would meet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh sat in a corner with his back to the wall.
He was protected by his position from any attack
except a frontal one, in case the companions of Dutch
moved to come to his rescue. They had, in point
of fact, no such intention. Though Dutch belonged
to their gang, he had always been an obnoxious bully.
He was a quarrelsome, venomous fellow, and more
than once had knifed or shot those of his own crowd.
Nobody liked him, least of all those who had accepted
him as leader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three-Fingered Jack leaned back with his elbows
hitched on the bar and grinned cynically as he
listened to the whining of the huge ruffian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He claims to be a man-eater, Sam does,” he
whispered to Daily. “Calls himself Chief of Main
Street. Fine. We’ll let him play his own hand.
He sure wouldn’t want us interferin’ against a kid.
All night I’ve listened to his brags about what all
he’d do to this McClintock guy. Now I’m waitin’
to see him do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s eatin’ the kid?” demanded Daily, also
in a whisper. “Why don’t he plug loose with the
fireworks? You can’t monkey with Sam. First
thing he knows he won’t know a thing, that kid
won’t. He’ll be a sure enough corpus delinqui.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Hugh took no chances. He knew what he
was waiting for. Thirty minutes by the watch he
held the desperado prisoner. When Dutch got
restless he tapped the table three times with his
finger tip, and the man began to sweat fear again.
The big bully never knew at what moment the boy
might crook his finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re goin’ on a journey,” Hugh explained
at last. “You’re takin’ the stage outa town. The
Candelabria one is the first that leaves. So you’re
booked for a seat in it. And you’re not buyin’ a
return trip ticket. Understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch understood humbly and gratefully. His
gratitude was not to this fool of a boy whom he
meant to destroy some day, but to the luck which
was bringing him alive out of the tightest hole he
had ever been in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under orders from Hugh the bartender disarmed
Dutch. Still covered by the shotgun, the sullen
dethroned chief climbed into the stage that was
about to leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From a saloon farther down the street a Negro’s
mellow voice was lifted in song:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Ole Dan and I, we did fall out,</p>
<p class='line0'>An’ what you t’ink it was about?</p>
<p class='line0'>He tread on my corn an’ I kick him on de shin,</p>
<p class='line0'>An’ dat’s de way dis row begin.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>So git out de way, ole Dan Tucker,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Git out de way, ole Dan Tucker,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Git out de way, ole Dan Tucker,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;You’re too late to come to supper.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>A crowd had gathered on the street. It watched
with eagerness the taming of this bad man. In the
old fighting West nobody was more despised than
a cowed “man-eater.” The good citizen who went
about his business and made no pretensions held
the respect of the community. Not so the gunman
whose bluff had been called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the outskirts of the crowd a quiet man—he
was Captain J. A. Palmer and he had nerves of steel—took
up the chorus of the song derisively. Others
began to hum it, at first timidly, then more boldly:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Git out de way, ole Dan Tucker,</p>
<p class='line0'>Git out de way, ole Dan Tucker,</p>
<p class='line0'>Git out de way, ole Dan Tucker,</p>
<p class='line0'>You’re too late to come to supper.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Before the last verse the song was going with a
whoop. Nearly everybody present had sidestepped
Dutch. Many had gone in fear of his vicious,
erratic temper. It was a great relief to see him
humiliated and driven away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch looked neither to the right nor to the left.
He sat hunched in his seat, head down and teeth
clenched. At any moment the demonstration might
turn into a lynching bee now that Aurora had lost
its fear of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stage rolled away in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh turned, to find himself facing Captain
Palmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know better than to let Sam Dutch
get away alive after you’ve got the drop on him?”
Palmer asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t kill him in cold blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hmp! He’d have killed you that way, wouldn’t
he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But I’m no murderer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Palmer looked the youth over with a new respect.
“Shoot straight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a pretty good shot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kill if you had to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young fellow, I want you. What you doing
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wood contract.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Finish it. Then come see me. We want a
shotgun messenger to ride with the stage. Got to
stop these hold-ups. Big pay and little work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh smiled. “Guaranteed as a nice safe job,
is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Safe as running Sam Dutch out of town,” Palmer
answered, meeting the smile with another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young McClintock shook his head. “Got another
job waiting—one with Uncle Sam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to join the army?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Captain nodded. “Good enough. Your country
has first call. Go to it, boy.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch13'>CHAPTER XIII</h1></div>

<h3>THE “STRANGLERS”</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span> letter</span> from Scot delayed Hugh for a time
from carrying out his intention of joining
the army. The older brother wrote that
he had been offered a commission and was anxious to
get to the front, but that certain matters were just
now keeping him in town. He did not mention that
he was waiting till Mollie closed out her little business
and moved to Carson, where she would be free of her
husband’s interference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news that his brother was going into the army
gave the boy a thrill. He had given his ardent
hero worship to Scot. He felt, as many others did,
too, that there were thwarted qualities of leadership
in Scot that might yet make of him a Broderick.
Between him and a big future there was no obstacle
but the wilful wildness of the man. He had everything
that made for success except stability of
purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a soldier he would be. What an officer
under whom to serve! Scot would make an ideal
cavalry chief. Young McClintock wrote back at
once that he would join his brother whenever he was
ready to leave. He wanted, if possible, to serve in
his company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The departure of Sam Dutch from Aurora did
not put an end to lawlessness there, though it undoubtedly
heartened the good people and prepared
the way for the drastic law-and-order programme
which followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Last Chance mines were producing amazingly.
There seemed no end to the riches in sight. Money
was easy, and the rough element flocked to the town
from California and the other Nevada camps. The
Sacramento and San Francisco gangs ran wild and
killed and maimed each other at will, but so long as
they let good citizens alone for the most part, no
efficient check was put upon them. The town went
its busy, turbulent, happy-go-lucky way. It sunk
shafts, built business blocks, established a company
of home guards known as the Esmeralda Rangers,
and in general made preparations for a continued
prosperity that was never to end. Two daily newspapers
supplied the eight thousand inhabitants with
the news of the world as it came in over the wire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ebb and flow of the tide of battle from the
great centres where the armies of Lee, Meade, Grant,
Buell, and Bragg struggled reached this far-off
frontier and drew a line of cleavage between the fiery
Southerners and the steadfast Northerners who
made up the population. Nevada had been made a
territory and the fight was on for statehood. President
Lincoln backed the party which demanded
admission. The reasons were both political and
financial. Later, Abraham Lincoln said that Nevada,
through the treasures of gold and silver which it
poured to the national capital, had been worth a
million men to the Union cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wood contract finished, Hugh took temporarily
a place with the express company as shotgun messenger.
The job was a very dangerous one. Hold-ups
were frequent, and the messenger did not get or expect
an even break. In the narrow twisting cañons
below the town it was easy to lie in ambush and surprise
the stage as it carried bullion from the mines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh was lucky. His stage was “stuck up” once,
but it chanced that no bullion was on board. On
another occasion he was wounded in an attempt at
robbery and left one of the bandits lying in the road
with a load of buckshot in him. His own wound was
slight. People began to say that he bore a charmed
life. The boy’s reputation for gameness was growing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bob Howland, a nephew of the territorial governor,
Nye, was city marshal. He asked young McClintock
to be his deputy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going to clean up this town and I need
help. You’ll sure have a merry time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh declined. “No, I’m going into the army
right away, soon as I hear from Scot. I’ll stick
with the stage till then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh had occasion next day to go into the Glory
Hole to speak with a man. He saw Bob Howland
talking to the girl dealing faro. The marshal walked
across the floor and joined McClintock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was smiling. “Come outside,” he said
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They strolled out together. “Jimmy Sayres was
killed this morning by Johnny Rogers,” Howland
explained. “You know Rogers is working for
Johnson on his ranch at Smith’s Valley. Jimmy and
a couple of other bummers were passing through
Wellington Station and picked up a good saddle horse
belonging to Johnson. Johnny buckled on his Colt’s
navy and hit the trail after them. Seems he caught
up with them near Sweetwater Station. They fired
at him. He got busy right then, and Sayres quit
taking any interest in the proceedings. The other
two thieves broke for the willows. Johnny took
the horse back with him. Good work, I say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sayres is one of the San Francisco gang. Isn’t
that likely to make trouble? The gang will be out
for revenge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Palmer has served notice on them to lay
off Johnny Rogers. If they don’t we’ll organize a
branch of the vigilantes, as they did at Virginia not
long since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it’s a showdown?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a showdown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was observable that the gang began to draw
together from that day. Minor differences of
opinion in its members were sunk in the common
need of a united front. Daily, Masterson, Buckley,
Vance, McDowell, Carberry, and their followers
could be seen swaggering in groups. Their attitude
was defiant. It would not have surprised Aurora to
learn any morning that Palmer or Rogers had been
shot down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vengeance of the gunmen fell instead on Johnson,
the rancher who had sent Rogers to get back the
stolen horse. He was warned not to show his face in
Aurora. The ranchman disregarded the threat and
came to town each week to sell his produce. He
made the trip once too often. His body was found
one morning lying in the street. During the night
he had been murdered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh was standing in front of the Novacovich
building when he heard of the killing. The man
who told him whispered a word in his ear. Instantly
the express messenger walked to his cabin.
He drew out a sawed-off shot gun from beneath the bed
and passed down Main Street to the Wingate building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already forty or fifty men were present, the pick
of the town. More were pouring in every minute.
Captain Palmer was the leader. As Hugh looked
from his cold stern face to those of the grim men
about him he knew that a day of judgment had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An organization of vigilantes was completed in a
few minutes. There was no debate, no appeal from
the decision of the chair. These citizens meant
business. They were present to get results swiftly
and efficiently. The men were divided into companies
with captains. One group was sent to take
charge of the Armoury, where the weapons of the
Esmeralda Rangers were kept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Palmer checked off a list of gunmen to be arrested.
This commission was given to Hugh. He divided
his company into groups and set about finding the
men whose names he had on the list.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of the desperadoes were taken completely
by surprise. They were captured in bed after being
aroused from sleep. Hugh himself broke down the
door of Jack Daily’s room after the man had refused
to open it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two faced each with a revolver in his hand.
Daily saw other men at the head of the stairs back
of McClintock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s all this row about?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“W. R. Johnson was killed in the night. You’re
wanted, Jack,” the young man answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Killed, was he? Well, he had it comin’,” jeered
the gunman. “You’ve heard about the pitcher
that went once too often to the well, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve heard about that pitcher, Jack. Have
you?” asked Hugh significantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daily tried to carry things off with a swagger.
“Been elected sheriff overnight, young fellow, in
place of Francis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a deputy. Drop that gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The desperado hesitated. Then, with a forced
laugh, he tossed his revolver upon the bed. “You’re
feelin’ yore oats since Dutch showed a yellow streak,
McClintock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Buckley had escaped and the sheriff sent a posse
after him. Two or three men on the list were in hiding
and could not at once be found, but the gather
in the net of the vigilantes was a large one. Later
in the day Buckley was brought to town. He had
been found skulking in a prospect hole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a disposition at first on the part of some
to let the machinery of the law take its course rather
than try the prisoners before a people’s court. The
leaders of the movement yielded to this sentiment so
far as to allow a preliminary hearing in the office of
Justice Moore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this hearing Vance, one of the gang whose name
somehow had not been included on the list, had the
hardihood to appear. He blustered and bullied,
though he was warned to remain silent. Presently,
just as he was reaching for a revolver, one of the
citizens’ posse wounded him in the arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Palmer, on behalf of the vigilantes, at
once brushed aside the formalities of the law and organized
a people’s court. He did not intend to let
the guilty men intimidate the court that was to try
them, nor to permit them to escape by means of
technicalities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About a dozen men were tried. They were
brought before the court and examined separately.
The evidence showed conclusively that Daily,
Buckley, Masterson, and McDonald had murdered
Johnson. The four were convicted and sentenced to
be hanged as soon as the carpenters could build a
gallows. Carberry, known as “Irish Tom,” escaped
the extreme penalty by one vote. That
deciding vote was cast by Hugh McClintock. Carberry
and his companions, shaky at the knees and
with big lumps in their throats, were dizzy with joy
at the sentence of banishment passed upon them.
They would have emigrated to Timbuctoo to escape
“the stranglers,” as they called the vigilantes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Someone—perhaps the sheriff, perhaps some friend
of the condemned men—wired Governor Nye for
help to save the gunmen. The Governor sent a telegram
to his nephew. The wire read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>It is reported here that Aurora is in the hands of a mob. Do
you need any assistance?</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Bob Howland sent a prompt message back. It
read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Everything quiet here. Four men will be hanged in fifteen
minutes.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The gallows had been built on the summit of the
hill in the centre of North Silver Street. There,
before the people whose laws they had mocked for so
long, the four killers paid the penalty of their crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young McClintock, in charge of the company
which guarded the gallows, was bloodless to the lips.
He felt faint and greatly distressed. There was
something horrible to him in this blotting out from
life of men who had no chance to make a fight for
existence. If a word of his could have saved them
he would have said it instantly. But in his heart
he knew the sentence was just. It meant the
triumph of law and order against violence. Killers
and gunmen would no longer dominate the camp
and hold it in bondage to fear. Honest citizens
could go about their daily business in security.</p>

<h3>COLONEL McCLINTOCK AGREES WITH VICKY</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he</span> pink of apple blossoms was in Mollie’s
cheeks, the flutter of a covey of quails in her
blood. At the least noise her startled heart
jumped. Sometimes it sang with a leaping joy
beyond control. Again it was drenched with a chill
dread. The Confederacy had made its last grand
gesture at Appomattox. A million men and more
were homeward bound. Scot McClintock had written
that to-day, on his way back to Virginia City
from the front, he would stop off at Carson for a
few hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was afraid to meet him. In the hour when
they had talked over their decision she had begged
him never to see her again, to put her out of his
mind as though he had never met her. The fear
lurked in the hinterland of her mind that perhaps he
had done this. He had been a soldier, busy with the
work given him to do, rising step by step by the force
of his personality. Was it likely he still cherished the
wild love, fruition of which had been denied them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie had always pushed far back into her secret
consciousness the sweet memories of Scot that had
persisted. It had been a matter of duty. Her code
bound her to the view that she could not be the
wife of one man, though in name only, and at the
same time love another even in the secret recesses
of her soul. Yet it was never hidden from her
that she loved Scot. No power within her could
change that. All she could do was to flog herself
because of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And to-day he was coming back, covered with
honour and glory. Was she going to meet a stranger
or the ardent friend who had brought colour into her
life?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into the house burst a girl, shining in the radiance
and clean strength of her young teens. She was
slim and straight and dark, and in her eager face
glowed a wonderful colour that came and went as
the flame of her emotions quickened or died. With
a whirlwind rush of her supple body she launched
herself on her sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mollie—Mollie darling,” she cried. “It’s
been the <span class='it'>longest</span> time since I saw you. What made
you stay so long up in Virginia? And who did you
see there? Tell me all about <span class='it'>everything</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A soft flame beat into the older sister’s cheeks.
Victoria’s enthusiasm was always a tonic for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve had a letter from—from Colonel McClintock,”
she said. “He expects to pass through Carson
this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky hugged her again. “Oh, goody, goody!
Three <span class='it'>whacking</span> cheers for our colonel.” It was
characteristic of her speech that stressed words stood
out like telegraph poles on a railroad track.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not our colonel,” reproved Mollie gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s mine,” answered Vicky. “Isn’t he my
guardian? And doesn’t he send me the <span class='it'>best</span> present
every Christmas? He likes you, too. Think I don’t
know, Sis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie’s startled eyes fastened to those of Vicky.
She was always being surprised by the acute observation
of this helter-skelter youngster. Of course
she couldn’t know, but——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you marry him, now you’ve got a
divorce?” the child rushed on with the ruthless innocence
of her age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colour poured into Mollie’s cheeks. “How
you talk!” she gasped. “About things you know
nothing about. He—Colonel McClintock—has been
a good friend to us. You mustn’t get foolish
notions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re <span class='it'>not</span> foolish.” She had Mollie in her arms
once more. “Why don’t you marry him, dearest?
I would. I’d snap him up. ’N him a hero—decorated
for bravery, like the <span class='it'>Enterprise</span> said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie’s eyes fell. “You mustn’t talk that way,”
she breathed tremulously. “You’re only a girl, and
you don’t know anything about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I just do,” triumphed Vicky. “You think
you’d stand in his way or <span class='it'>somep’n</span> now he’s a big
officer. Or you think——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think your imagination is too active, dear,”
Mollie countered drily. “You haven’t the least
reason to think there is anything but friendship between
me and Colonel McClintock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky caught her by the shoulders. “Sister
Mollie, can you tell me, honest Injun, that you don’t
love him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gaze of Mollie wavered before the steady
searching eyes of inexorable youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or that he doesn’t care for you?” Vicky went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a mist of tears in Mollie’s eyes. “How
do I know? I haven’t seen him for years. Maybe
he doesn’t—any longer——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl protested vigorously. “Don’t you know
him better’n that? Of <span class='it'>course</span> he does. You’ll see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pent-up secret of Mollie’s heart came out
tremulously. “I sent him away. I told him to
forget me. Men don’t remember always—like we
women do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky took active charge of the campaign. “I’ll
tell you what, Sister Mollie. You put on that blue-print
dress, the one with the flowered pattern—an’
lemme fix your hair—an’ when you see him forget
every single thing except how glad you are to see
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Light-footed and swift, Vicky moved about the
room making ready for the transformation of her
sister. She was a girl given at times to silences, but
just now she was voluble as a magpie. Her purpose
was to divert Mollie’s thoughts from herself for the
present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the flowered dress had been donned and the
soft thick hair arranged to Vicky’s satisfaction, that
young lady stood back and clapped her hands.
“Come into the parlour and look at the sweetest
and prettiest thing in Carson,” she cried, catching
her sister’s hand and dragging her forward. “If
Colonel McClintock doesn’t think you’re <span class='it'>just dear</span>,
it’ll be because he’s gone blind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie took one look in the glass, then caught at the
sideboard to steady herself. For a voice from the
doorway answered Vicky’s prophecy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He does think so, just as he always has.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot came across the room in three long strides
and swept Mollie into his arms. The breath of life
flooded her cheeks and flung out a flag of joy. Her
soldier had come home from the wars. He still
wanted her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve heard,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That the courts have freed you. Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie wept happy tears through which smiles
struggled. Vicky, dominated by a sense of delicacy,
regretfully withdrew and left them to talk the murmurous
disjointed language of lovers that has come
down from Adam and Eve in the garden. Fifteen
minutes later she poked her head back into the room
and coughed discreetly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vicky, when can you have my girl ready?” Scot
demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ready for what?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she knew for what. Her face sparkled. The
slim body wriggled with excitement, as a happy, expectant
puppy does.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the wedding, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In twenty minutes,” answered Vicky promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. I met Father Marston at the Ormsby
House when the stage came in. I’ll be back in
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie protested, blushing. She had no clothes.
She did not think she wanted to be married in such a
hurry. Proper arrangements must be made. Vicky
and Scot brushed her excuses aside peremptorily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his blue uniform McClintock strode down the
street, the sword still swinging at his side. He knew
where to find Father Marston, who was chaplain of
the legislature, now in special session.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delavan Marston was a character. Rough and
rugged, he struck straight from the shoulder. His
tastes and habits were liberal. He liked a good
cigar and a good glass of wine. Generally he was
called Father Marston, though he was a Protestant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose, tall and gaunt, to open the assembly with
prayer, just as Scot came into the hall. The soldier
listened to a remarkable petition. A member of the
legislature had been complaining because the chaplain’s
prayers were too long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they don’t get practical results,” the member
had added. “If they’d make the rock in my tunnel
any softer or the water in my ditch more plentiful I’d
favour ’em. But they look to me like a waste of
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A kind friend had reported the grumbler’s words to
Marston. This morning he made his petition short
enough and direct enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Lord,” he prayed sonorously, “we ask Thee to
remember in particular one of our number. Make
the rock in his tunnel as soft as his head and the water
in his ditch as plentiful as the whisky he daily drinks.
Amen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock stopped the parson on his way out of
the building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Marston swept the handsome figure from
head to foot with his grim eyes. He was very fond
of Scot McClintock, but he disapproved of many of
his actions. He was the only man alive except old
Alexander McClintock who dared tell him so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Colonel, that uniform is an honour to any living
man. They tell me you’ve not disgraced it in the
army. That’s right. I’d expect you to be a good
soldier. But there are soldiers of peace, sir. They
have their battles to fight, too. Isn’t it about time
you quit hellin’ around and set this country round
here a good example? Folks like and admire you.
The Lord knows why. They set a heap o’ store by
you. They’ll be disappointed if you go back to
dealing faro.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot gave him his frank disarming smile. “I’ll
not disappoint them in that particular way, Father.
Hugh and I are going into business together as soon
as he is discharged from the army. Tell you-all
about that later. Right now I want you to marry
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Mrs. Dodson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A divorced woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot met him eye to eye. “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe in divorces, Colonel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are divorces and divorces, Father. Do
you know anything about Robert Dodson and Mollie
Dodson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know ’em both. She’s a good woman. The less
said about him the better, I reckon. Maybe she’s entitled
to a good husband. Looks thataway to me.
I’ll marry you. If it’s a sin the Lord will have to
charge it against me. When do you want to be
married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now. Soon as I can get a license. Meet you
at her house in fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be there on time, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Marston was waiting when Scot reached
the house with the license.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky came into the parlour, slim and straight as a
half-grown boy. She drew her heels together and
lifted a hand to her rebellious black hair. “Colonel,
I have to report that the bride is ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Vicky it seemed that all Mollie’s troubles would
now melt in the warm sunshine of happiness. She
could not understand the reason for the tremulous
mist of tears in her sister’s soft eyes while she made
the responses. After the ceremony she flung herself
into Mollie’s arms and kissed her rapturously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always wanted a sure enough prince for you,
Mollie,” she whispered. “And now you’ve got him.
Don’t you dare not to be happy now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie nodded, swallowing a lump in her throat.
She did not know whether happiness was to be her
portion or not. All she was sure of was that she
could walk through life beside the man she loved.
And that, just now, was all she asked.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch15'>CHAPTER XV</h1></div>

<h3>HUGH LEARNS OLD GRIMES IS STILL DEAD</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>F</span>ortune</span> picks her favourites strangely. While
the McClintocks were away at the war Robert
Dodson, incompetent and worthless, developed
from a pauper to a millionaire. His was one of the
sudden shifts of luck to which Virginia City was becoming
used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most men in the camp had a trunkful of mining
stock picked up here and there, a lot of it feet in
wildcat concerns hawked about in exchange for meal
tickets, boots, shirts, liquor, and other supplies.
This was scattered so promiscuously that one could
acquire reams of it without giving much in actual
value for it. Dodson’s rise to affluence was a camp
joke. It was said that he sold two bags of bones and
a pile of kindling for a million dollars. What he
actually did was to swap his ramshackle wagon and
starving team for fifty feet in the Never Say Die,
twenty-five feet in the Gambler’s Luck, twenty in
the Mollie Macrae, and fifteen in the Road to China.
He was given a quart of whisky to boot. The trade
was made while Dodson was drunk, and all his saloon
cronies chuckled over the way he had been sold. For
all of these were stock jobbing enterprises and nothing
more. None of them were doing any developing
at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mine adjacent to the Never Say Die and the
Gambler’s Luck struck it rich. There was a sympathetic
boom in mines of surrounding territory.
The Never Say Die sank a shaft and ran a crosscut.
This cut into a vein that appeared to be a bonanza.
Half seas over again, Dodson sold out his interest in
both prospects at the height of the boom. Within a
week it was known that the crosscut had run into
only a small pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luck pursued Dodson. It would not let him
alone. He took a flyer in Ophir stock, and the
Ophir soared. He invested in Crown Point and the
Belcher. Both were big winners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently a younger brother of the new magnate
appeared on the scene to manage his interests. Ralph
Dodson was a big athletic fellow with glossy black
hair and small black moustache. The dark eyes
were keen and cold. They roved a good deal, but it
was noticeable that they came to pause whenever
they fell on a good-looking woman. He had a hail-fellow-well-met
manner, but there was something
hard and icy in him that frustrated his jollity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The younger brother had a powerful influence over
Robert Dodson. The man pulled himself up and
stopped drinking. He was of nature parsimonious,
and he hung on to his fortune in spite of the parasites
who fawned on him. Ralph’s cool business judgment
was a factor in the rapid increase of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot McClintock returned to civil life to find that
the wastrel and ne’er-do-well was an important
figure in the community. He had the responsibilities
that go with wealth, and these always entail a certain
amount of public recognition. The bullet head
of Robert Dodson might be seen among the notables
at the International Hotel. His shifty yellow eyes
looked down from the platform on various important
occasions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both Scot and his brother had saved money.
They had, too, a long credit at the banks and among
private friends. They went into freighting on an
extensive scale. They bought teams, increasing
gradually the size of their business. Ore and wood
contracts were their specialties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dan De Quille has said that the Comstock is the
tomb of the forests of the Sierras. This is literally
true. Already enough timber had been buried in
the Lode to build a city several times as large as
San Francisco was. The square-set system of
timbering, invented by Philip Deidesheimer, made it
possible to develop the mines to a great depth in
spite of the tendency of the ground to cave.
But this necessitated hauling timber from a
distance. The nearer slopes of the range were already
denuded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon this need the McClintocks built their business.
It prospered year by year, for both members
of the firm were shrewd and energetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky had remained at school in Carson when
Scot moved to Virginia City. When she reached the
age of sixteen Scot sent her to a young lady’s seminary
at San Francisco where she could have better
advantages. For a year she remained in the city
at the Golden Gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It chanced that Hugh had not seen Vicky since the
day when she first set out for school at Carson years
ago. Upon the occasions of her visits to Mollie’s
house he had been out of town on business. Once he
had called at Miss Clapp’s to see her, but Miss
Victoria happened to be up King’s Cañon gathering
wild flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s she look like now?” Hugh asked Scot
when he heard the girl was returning from San
Francisco. “Must be a right sizable little girl now, I
reckon. Last time I was in Sacramento I sent her a
nigger toll. Here’s the letter she wrote me. I’d
think they’d teach her to spell better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot read the note.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Dere Mister Santa Claws</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>I got the doll. Thank you very much for it. I like dolls. I
am lerning speling, reading, riting, gography, numbers, grammar,
and deportment. Deportment is when you say thanks to a kind
gentelman for giveing you a doll. We had bluebery pie for
dinner. Do you like bluebery pie? I do. Wel I must close
for this time your greatful little friend <span class='sc'>Victoria Lowell</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The older brother wiped a smile from his face as he
looked at Hugh. The note was like the little vixen
who had written it. She was having her fun with
Hugh, who seemed to have forgotten that in the
course of four years children of Vicky’s sex have a
habit of shooting up into young ladies. A black doll!
Well, Hugh had brought it on himself. Scot did not
intend to spoil sport. He told a part of the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a pretty good match for the black doll herself—the
blackest little thing you ever saw. Hair
flies wild. A good deal of long arms and legs about
her. Some whirlwind when she gets started.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always was that,” Hugh said. “I can imagine
how she looks. Blueberry pie painted on her face
when she wrote that letter probably.” He shifted
the conversation to business. “Are you going down
to Piodie or do you want me to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Piodie was the newest camp in Nevada. Discovery
of ore had just been made and a stampede for
the new diggings was on. They were said to be very
rich in both gold and silver. If this proved true,
the handling of freight to the new camp would be
profitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You go, Hugh. I don’t want to leave Mollie
just now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the mining country camps have their little day
and cease to be. They wallow in prosperity and
never dream of the time when the coyote will howl
in their lonesome streets. A camp which “comes
back” is as rare as a pugilist who recovers a lost
championship. Aurora’s star had set. The live
citizens were flitting, and the big mines were pulling
their pumps. The name on every tongue was Piodie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” agreed Hugh. “I been wantin’ to
have a look at that camp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take your time. No hurry. Look the ground
over carefully. The business will run right along
while you’re away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hope Mollie gets along fine,” Hugh said awkwardly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man was now a responsible member of
a business firm which handled a large trade. The
days when he had ridden pony express, even the
ones when he had left the army with a sergeant’s
stripes on his sleeve, belonged to his adventurous
past. Young as he was, Hugh served on civic
committees and attended board of trade banquets.
In his heart sometimes he rebelled. He did not look
forward with eagerness to the day when he would
be a leading citizen with an equatorial paunch.
The blood of youth still sang in him a saga of untravelled
trails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps that was why he chose to ride to Piodie
instead of taking a seat beside “Pony” King on the
stage. It was a day of the gods as he rode up the
Geiger Grade from B Street. His lungs drank in the
rare air like wine. The sky was crystal clear except
for a long-drawn wisp of cloud above the summit of
Mt. Davidson. Below him a cañon cleft the hills,
and beyond its winding gorge was a glimpse of soft-toned
desert through which ran a gleaming silver
ribbon edged with the green of cottonwood foliage.
Far away, at the horizon edge, were white mountain
barriers, the Sierras to the right, the Humboldt and
the Pine Nut ranges to the east.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was noon when he reached Reno, the new town
which had just changed its name from End-of-the-Track.
The Central Pacific, built the previous
year, had brought Reno into existence. It was still
a little village. If any one had predicted then that
the day was coming when both Carson and Virginia
would be displaced in importance by the little railroad
station Reno, he would have been judged a poor
guesser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh jogged along at the steady road gait which
is neither quite a trot nor a walk. The miles fell
behind him hour after hour. The sun sank into the
hills and left behind it a great splash of crimson
glory. This faded to a soft violet, which in turn
deepened to a lake of purple as the evening shadows
lengthened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The traveller camped in the sage. He scooped
out a hole in the soft sand and built in it a fire of
greasewood and brush. This he kept replenished till
it was full of live coals. He knew it would last till
morning without fresh fuel. Supper finished, he
rolled up in his blanket and found for a pillow the
softest spot in the saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His brain buzzed with thoughts of the old riding
days when life had been an adventure and not a
humdrum business. Into his memory there sang
itself a chantey of the trail. He found himself now
murmuring the words drowsily:</p>

<p class='line0'>“Last night as I lay on the prairie,</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The tune of it followed in a rough way that of “My
Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean.” Stanza after stanza
Hugh sang it softly, and each time as he came to the
chorus his brain was a little less active, his eyes a
little heavier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fell asleep with the words on his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gray of dawn was streaking the east when he
awoke. After breakfast he fell again into the jog-trot
of travel. The sage hills slipped behind him,
and always there were others to replace the ones that
had vanished. The sun crept high and became a ball
of fire in the sky. Dust in yellow clouds, fine and
penetrating, sifted over and into him. His eyes
became irritated with it and his throat caked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late afternoon when he rode down through
Piodie Cañon to the flats where enterprising real
estate agents were laying out suburbs of the new
camp. Hugh turned in at a feed corral and swung
from the saddle stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A familiar voice lifted itself in tuneless but cheerful
song:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Hugh grinned. “The dawggoned old-timer. I

himself.</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>continued the singer from the stable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock tiptoed forward and looked in. A
man of Falstaffian girth was oiling a set of harness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t old man Grimes wore out them blue pants
yet?” asked Hugh, dropping into the free-and-easy
speech of his youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fat man whirled. “Hell’s hinges! If it
ain’t Kid McClintock. Where did you drap from?”
He fell on the young man and pounded him with his
hamlike fists. “Say, I’ll bet Byers’ll be plumb
tickled to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Byers here, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure as you’re a foot high. That damn railroad
done run us outa business. So we got this feed
corral here. Didn’t you see the sign: Pony Express
Corral, Budd &amp; Byers, Props?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re sure some prop, Jim. Don’t you reckon
you’re most a pillar? By jiminy, you been takin’
on flesh since I saw you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hmp! Nothin’ of the kind,” snorted Budd
indignantly. “Shows what you know. I been
losin’ flesh, if you want the straight goods. Pillar,
shucks! If you had enough education to outfit a
Piute you’d sabe that ‘Props.’ is short for Proprietors.
It means we own this here place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh registered intelligence. “Oh, I get you.
Why, dad gum it, I’m a prop, my own se’f. Freighting
and Contracting, McClintock &amp; McClintock,
Props.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I done heard you been keepin’ two jumps
ahead of the wolf. I reckon that’s why you come to
a good town at last.” Budd’s body shook with mirth
like an immense jelly. This was his idea of repartee
as was repartee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Is</span> it a good camp?” asked Hugh seriously.
“That’s what I came to find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kid, it’s a sockdolager. Them hills is full of
silver. All you got to do is to drive a pick in and find
the ore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all you’ve got to do anywhere in these
United States,” agreed McClintock drily. “Question
is, will you find it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Budd began to sputter with excitement. In the
West it always has been the first article of a man’s
faith to believe in his town. One might have slandered
the fat man’s relatives and hoped to escape
alive, but for Piodie he would have fought at the drop
of a hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—why—doggone yore hide, kid, this camp’s
got Virginia skinned four ways from Sunday. It’s
the best ever. Ore from the grass roots. Everywhere—all
’round. Millions o’ tons of it.” He
waved a fat hand expansively as he warmed to his
theme. “This here town is built in the heart of
nature’s storehouse, the mint where her auriferous
deposits were planted when the Sierras was a hole
in the ground. Son, you tie up to Piodie an’ you’ll
sure do yorese’f proud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of his oration a small wiry man
stepped unobtrusively into the stable. Hugh deserted
Budd to greet his partner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byers, always taciturn, broke a record and made a
long speech. He said, “Glad to see you.”</p>

<h3>IN THE PIT OF NIGHT</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>ugh</span> strolled down Turkey Creek Avenue
and lost himself in the crowd which filled the
walks and jostled its overflow into the road.
Piodie called itself a city, but it had as yet no street
lights, no sewers, no waterworks, no graded roads,
and no sidewalks other than a few whipsawed planks
laid by private enterprise. It had, however, plenty
of saloons, dance halls, and gambling houses. These
advertised their wares to the world with a childlike
candour, flinging shafts of light from windows and
open doors upon the muddy lane between the rows of
buildings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was alive with the jubilant and raucous
gaiety of a young mining camp. Pianos jingled and
fiddles whined dance music to the accompaniment of
shuffling feet. The caller’s sing-song lifted above the
drone of voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alemane left. Right hand to yore pardner an’
grand right an’ left. Swing yore pardners an’ promenade
you know where.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was punctuated by loud and joyous whoops
from a dancer who had been imbibing not wisely but
too well. Laughter, the rattle of chips, the clink of
glasses, the hum of inaudible words, all contributed
to the medley of sound rising into the starlit night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock weaved in and out, eyes and ears open
to get a line on the town. It was a live camp. So
much was apparent at a glance. But how much of
this life was due to the money that had been brought
here, how much of it to the ore which had been taken
out of the Piodie mines. He met acquaintances, men
he had known at Aurora and Virginia City. These
introduced him to others. From them he heard
fabulous stories of suddenly acquired wealth. Mike
Holloway had bumped into a regular “glory hole”
to-day that would make him a millionaire. The
Standard Union was shipping ore assaying so much a
ton that the amount had to be whispered. Compared
to this town, Aurora, Dayton, Gold Hill, and
Eureka were built on insignificant lodes. Hugh detected
in much of this a note of exaggeration, but he
knew that at bottom there was a large sediment of
truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went out again from the saloon where he had
been gathering information and joined the floating
population outside. In sex it was largely masculine.
The feminine percentage was rouged and gaudily
dressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without any plan he drifted down Turkey Creek
Avenue enjoying the raw, turbulent youth of the
place. Two men were standing in the shadow of
an unlighted building as he passed. McClintock did
not see them. One of the men pressed the other’s
arm with his hand to give a warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s Hugh McClintock,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second—a huge slouching figure with unkempt
hair and beard—gave from his throat a guttural
snarl. Simultaneously his hand slipped back toward
his hip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not right here, Dutch,” the smaller man murmured.
“If you want him get him from the alley
as he’s comin’ back. You can do that an’ make yore
getaway back to Monument Street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh wandered to the end of the street, unaware
of the lumbering figure that followed warily on the
other side of the road. The street came to an end
at a sheer hill rise. Here the young man stood for
several minutes enjoying the quiet of the black night.
Faintly the noise of Piodie’s exuberance drifted on
the light breeze. At this distance it was subdued
to a harmony not unpleasant to the ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time he turned and walked slowly back
toward the business section of town. He took his
way leisurely. He had nothing to do but turn in at
his lodging place, and the night was still young.
Out in the open it was pleasanter than in a stuffy
room, eight by eight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The buildings had been put up in a haphazard
fashion without much regard to the street frontage,
entirely as the fancy of the owners had dictated.
Hugh came to one abutting on the alley. It was a
storage warehouse, and it projected almost into the
street. In the lee of it the young man stopped to
light a cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something whizzed past his ear and stuck quivering
in the wooden wall. In the darkness streaks of
fire flamed—one, two, three. The roar of the shots,
pent in the alleyway, boomed like those of a howitzer.
With one swift dive of his lithe body Hugh
found cover behind a dry-goods box. In transit his
revolver leaped to air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he did not fire. He lay, crouched close
against the box, listening with taut nerves for any
sound that might betray the position of his enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None came. Presently he peered round the corner
of the box. The darkness was Stygian. The blackness
of the night was emphasized by the narrowness
of the alley. Somewhere in that dark pit before him
the ambusher lay, unless he had crept noiselessly
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Protected by the box, Hugh might have crawled
to the corner of the building, turned it, and so escaped.
But he had no thought of doing this. He
meant to find out if possible who this expert knife
thrower was. If he had in town an enemy who
hated him enough to lie in wait to do murder it was
his business to discover who the man was. First, he
wanted to get the ruffian lying thirty or forty feet
from him. Next, he meant to try to gain possession
of the knife sticking in the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second hand of his watch ticked away the
minutes. The large hand moved from the figures
III to IV, crept on to V, passed the half-hour mark.
Hugh did not know how long he lay there. His
guess would have been hours. He began to think
that the other man had made an escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On hands and knees, the barrel of his revolver
clenched between his strong white teeth, McClintock
crawled round the box, hugging the wall closely as he
moved. His advance was noiseless, slow, so careful
that it was punctuated with a dozen stops to listen.
Someone was beating a drum down the street and the
sound of it deadened any closer stir. He calculated
that this was an advantage as well as a drawback.
If he could not hear the other man, then it followed
that the other man could not hear him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Plank by plank he followed the wall, each motion
forecast and executed so deliberately that it could
not betray him. In the dense darkness he could see
nothing, but he estimated he must be close to the
knife in the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose to his knees, still without a sound. His
hand groped for the hilt of the bowie. It closed on—a
thick hairy wrist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goddamighty!” a startled voice screamed, and the
wrist was jerked swiftly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh’s brain functioned instantly. The owner of
the knife, moved by the same desire as himself, had
crept forward to recover it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock plunged, head down and arms wide.
His full weight back of the drive, he crashed into the
retreating enemy and flung him backward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The marching years had developed Hugh. His
stringiness was gone. He was a large man, tall and
straight, with hard-packed muscles. No wildcat of
the Sierras was more lithe and supple than he. But
as he struggled with this ruffian, now on top, now
underneath, their legs thrashing wildly as each
tried to pin the other down, McClintock knew that
the fellow with whom he grappled was bigger than
he, thicker through the body, broader across the
shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They whirled over and over. Thick thighs
clamped themselves to Hugh’s waist. Huge fingers
closed on his throat. He threw up an arm, and at
the same time a jagged bolt of pain shot through it.
In the flesh of the biceps the blade of a bowie
sheathed itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His breath shut off, the warm blood welling from
his arm, Hugh gave a desperate heave of his body
and flung the man astride of him forward and to the
left. He spun round with pantherish swiftness and
launched himself at the bulk of energy gathering
itself for another attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went down together, Hugh on top. His
wounded arm pinned down the wrist with the knife.
The assassin felt for McClintock’s eye socket with
his thumb and gouged at it. The niceties of civilized
warfare had no place in this conflict with a primordial
brute. Dodging the thumb, Hugh found his mouth
pressed against the forearm he held captive. The
strong teeth that had been carrying the revolver
until the two had come to grips closed on the tendons
of the hairy arm. The man underneath gave a yell
of pain. His fingers relaxed and opened. The handle
of the bowie slipped away from them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With his free arm the gunman tried to drag out a
revolver. Hugh’s fist, hard as knotted pine, drove
savagely into the bearded face. It struck again and
again, with the crushing force of a pile driver.
Grunting with pain, the murderer covered up to escape
punishment. He was lying cramped against
the wall in such a way that he could not get at his
six-shooter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man bellowed with rage and thrashed about
to avoid that flailing fist. His boot heel found a
purchase against the wall and he used it to pry himself
out of the corner into which he had been flung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fighters rolled out from the building, for the
moment free of each other. A flying boot struck
Hugh in the forehead and dazed him. He scrambled
to his feet. His foe was legging it down the alley
with all the grace of a bear in a hurry to get away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock started to pursue, then changed his
mind abruptly. The man was armed and he was
not. If he should run him down the ruffian would
turn and murder him. At least he had written his
John Hancock on the fellow’s face and would know
him again if he saw him soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The victor quartered over the ground. Presently
he found his revolver and the bowie knife that had
slashed his arm. He slid the revolver into its holster
and the knife into his boot leg. From the alley he
stepped back to the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drum was still booming. He guessed that
the affray had not taken more than five minutes
from start to finish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time he became aware of a throbbing
pain in his arm. When he pulled up his sleeve he
saw that it was soggy with blood. The sight of
the long jagged wound affected him oddly. He
leaned against a hitching post for support, overcome
by a faintness which surged over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed grimly. “Blood beginnin’ to scare
you at this late date,” he said to himself aloud.
This brought him a touch of sardonic amusement.
He had passed through three big pitched battles
of the war, half-a-dozen skirmishes, and had been
slightly wounded twice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For first aid he tied a handkerchief around the
wound as best he could, using his free hand and his
teeth to make the knot. Ten minutes later he was
in the office of a doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re lucky,” the doctor said. “Knife ploughed
along close to the surface. Didn’t strike an artery.
How’d you come to do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t do it. The other fellow did. With
this.” Hugh pulled the bowie from his boot leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he had dressed the wound the doctor examined
the murderous-looking knife. He handed it
back to Hugh with a dry comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I say you were lucky? That’s a weak word
for it. You must carry the left hind foot of a graveyard
rabbit caught in the dark of the moon. How
did he come to leave that knife behind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t explain why. I kinda gathered he
was in a hurry. Probably had an engagement down
the street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor’s keen eyes took in the strong grave
face, the splendid figure, the imperturbable composure
of the patient. It occurred to him that a
Sierra grizzly would be no more dangerous than this
man if he were aroused to action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you kill him?” he asked hesitantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not this time,” McClintock answered quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he left, the doctor’s gaze followed him out
of the office. He wondered who this light-stepping
Hermes could be. In his years of practice he had
never met a finer specimen of humanity, judged on a
physical basis of health, strength, and coördination
of nerves and muscle.</p>

<h3>A KNIFE WITH FOURTEEN NOTCHES</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>ugh</span> was feeding his horse next morning

<p class='noindent'>Budd informed the world at large by way of announcing
his arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When’s the funeral, Jim?” asked McClintock.
“I’ll be there if it’s soon. Like to be right sure he’s
buried. Don’t mind pilin’ a big flat rock on top o’
that single-breasted coat my own se’f.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fat man looked at him severely. “Young
fella, I been hearin’ about you. Met up with Doc
Rogers. Says you got all cut up. How about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doc Rogers ought to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it serious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d say it was serious. Cost me twenty-five
dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rogers ain’t no two-bit man,” Budd explained
with pride. “Piodie is sure one high tariff town.
Nothing cheap about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s where he’s gettin’ ready to stick me on my
feed bill,” Hugh mentioned to his buckskin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not on yore tintype. Yore money’s no good at
the Pony Express Corral, Kid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much obliged to Budd &amp; Byers, Props.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sho, we’ll quit business when we can’t feed a
friend’s bronc onct in a while. Say, was you much
hurt, Kid? An’ how come it? Never knew you to go
hellin’ around askin’ for trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, an’ you never will. I sure wasn’t askin’ for
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byers had joined them. He nodded silently to
Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who did it?” asked Budd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wish you’d tell <span class='it'>me</span> that, Jim. He didn’t leave
his name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’d he look like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He <span class='it'>felt</span> like a ton of bricks when he landed on me.
I don’ know how he looked. It was darker than the
inside of Jonah’s whale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell it to us,” urged Budd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh told the story of the attack on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ you don’t know who the scalawag was?”
asked the fat man when he had finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t <span class='it'>know</span>. I’ve got a guess—several of
’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For instance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Sam Dutch living here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep. He’s the handy man of the Dodsons—camp
bouncer, killer, mine jumper, general all-round
thug.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Dodsons are the big moguls here, seems to
me from what I hear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They come clost to it—own the Standard Union
and the Katie Brackett, have a controllin’ interest
in both stamp mills, run the stage line an’ the Mammoth
saloon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the big store, Dodson &amp; Dodson. They
own that, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep, an’ the building it’s in. Fact is, they’ve
got title to half the lots in town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re a sweet pair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure are. Run the politics, too. The sheriff’s
their property. The job’s worth twenty thousand a
year, an’ they elected him. Course he’s good an’
grateful. Why shouldn’t he be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So Dutch carries the Dodson brand, does he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He does their dirty work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And his own, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve a notion Mr. Dutch has my autograph
stamped on his face this glad mo’ning,” drawled
Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry to hear that. It’ll mean trouble unless
you leave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what he told me at Aurora,” Hugh
answered quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard about that. You’ve got his number.
So has yore brother. Makes it worse. You’ll get
no even break from him. It’ll be like last night.
A shot outa the dark. Only next time he won’t
miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure it was Dutch. I was one of the
vigilance committee at Aurora. We ran a bunch
of thugs from town. Might be any one of that
gang. Or someone may have took me for Scot.
He has enemies, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ you’re the spittin’ image of him, Kid. That
last is one good guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoever he was he left his card behind him.”
Hugh stooped and drew from his boot leg a bowie
knife with a horn handle. Upon the lower part of the
horn had been filed fourteen little notches. “This
was the sticker he flung at me. He was in a hurry
and didn’t take it with him when he vamosed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byers examined the knife and spoke for the first
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dutch claims fourteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m going to advertise it in the paper and
give the owner a chance to reclaim his property,”
McClintock said grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t that be a call for a showdown?” Budd
asked gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I aim to call for one. Then I’ll know Mr. Pig
Sticker is sittin’ on the other side of the table from
me an’ ain’t pluggin’ me in the back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he stands for a showdown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he stands for one. If he don’t, well, I’ll call
his bluff that he’s chief of Piodie, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sure want to pack a good gun handy, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byers nodded agreement. The simple direct way
always suited him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fat man glanced at his partner before he
changed the subject. “We had a talk yestiddy after
you left, Kid, me’n Dan. We’re locatin’ a bunch
of claims on Bald Knob. Looks to us like a good
chance. The stampeders are all headed over Antelope
Hill way, but there ain’t no reason why there
shouldn’t be ore acrost the valley, too. Anyhow,
we’re gonna take a crack at it. A bird in the hand
gathers no moss, as the old sayin’ ain’t. We had a
notion to ask you to go in with us. Needs three to
handle the thing, account of claim jumpers in case
we make a strike. But I don’t reckon now you’d
want to stay here permanent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This climate ain’t suitable for you. Too many
gunmen who don’t like the colour of yore hair. I
reckon there are seven or eight of them birds you
helped run outa Aurora, let alone Dutch. Irish
Tom is in our midst, as the old sayin’ is, and Vance
and that mule-skinner Hopkins. It’s a cinch they
don’t waste any time loving Kid McClintock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ve got a proposition that looks good to me,
you can forget the quick-on-the-trigger gang. I’m
not the only Aurora vigilante in town. Last night
I met several. The gunmen won’t look for trouble
on that account. We might start something again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll sure talk turkey if you feel that way.
What say we ride up Bald Knob, an’ if you like the
lay of the land, we’ll make our locations?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suits me fine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Few people can live in a new and prosperous mining
camp without catching the contagion of the
speculator. The magic word, whether it be gold,
silver, or oil, sets the blood afire with the microbe of
unrest. Just beyond reach of the hand lies a fortune.
The opportunity of a lifetime is knocking at the door.
All the spirit of adventure in one leaps to the risk.
Sedate caution seems a dull-spirited jade at such a
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh was no exception to the rule. As he had
passed to and fro among the miners in the saloons
and gaming halls last night the stories to which he
had listened quickened his blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was ready for a hazard of new fortunes as soon
as he could shake the dice.</p>

<h3>APPLY TO HUGH McCLINTOCK</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>ugh</span> dropped into the office of the Piodie
<span class='it'>Banner</span> and paid for an advertisement in the
paper and for two hundred and fifty posters
set with display type.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The editor glanced over the copy. “I can get the
bills out this afternoon. The ad will appear in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheet of paper handed in by McClintock bore
no evidence of being loaded with dynamite. Upon it
was printed roughly with a pencil this notice:</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>FOUND</p>

<p class='line'>To Property</p>
<p class='line'>Apply To Hugh McClintock</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The owner of the printing plant looked the copy
over a second time. “ ’Course, I’m not here to turn
business away, Mr. McClintock, but—well, are the
dodgers necessary? Wouldn’t the ad in the paper
be enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe so. But I want to be sure the owner sees
it. I reckon I’ll take the bills, too,” Hugh said easily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hired an old coloured man to tack up the bills
on buildings, fences, and posts. To make sure that
they were in conspicuous places Hugh went along
himself. He also made arrangements with saloon
keepers and gambling house owners by which he was
allowed to have the posters put on the walls of these
resorts. His manner was so matter of fact that not
one of his innocent accomplices suspected there was
more behind the advertisement than appeared on the
face of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fourteen notches. Looks like it might be Sam
Dutch’s bowie you found, stranger,” one bartender
suggested. “This camp sure howls, but I reckon it
ain’t got many fourteen notchers. Only one far as
I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the knife belongs to Mr. Dutch he can have it
by applying for it,” Hugh said mildly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect he can have ’most anything he wants
in this man’s town if he sure enough asks for it,” the
man in the apron grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the middle of the afternoon, at which hour he
first daily appeared to the world, Sam Dutch slouched
down town with a story already prepared to account
for his battered face. The tale he meant to tell
was that in the darkness he had fallen into a prospect
hole and cut his cheeks, forehead, and lips on
the sharp quartz he had struck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On a telegraph pole near the end of Turkey Creek
Avenue a poster caught his eye. He read it with
mixed emotions. The predominating ones were
rage, a fury of hate, and an undercurrent of apprehension.
He tore the bill down and trampled it in
the mud under his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half a minute later he saw a second bill, this time
on the side of a store. This, too, he destroyed, with
much explosive language. Between Rawhide Street
and the Porphyry Lode saloon he ripped down three
more notices of the finding of a bowie knife with
fourteen notches. When he stopped at the bar and
ordered a brandy sling the man was dangerous as a
wounded grizzly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bartender chatted affably. He was in the
habit of saying that he had not lost any quarrels with
gunmen and he did not intend to find any.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine glad day, Mr. Dutch. Nice change from
Monday. Hotter’n hell or Yuma then, I say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bad man growled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was sure enough spittin’ cotton. Went up the
gulch with T. B. Gill. Creek’s dry as a cork leg.
Good rain wouldn’t hurt none,” the young fellow
went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Nother’fthesame,” snarled Dutch, his voice
thick with uncontrollable fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bartender made a mental comment. “Sore’s
a toad on a hot rock this mo’ning.” He tried another
subject, with intent to conciliate. “Young
fellow in a while back and wanted to hang up a bill.
I said, ‘Sure, hop to it.’ Ain’t lost any hog stickers
myse’f, but maybe some other gent——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch glared round, found the bill with his eyes,
and dragged out a navy revolver. Three bullets
crashed through the poster and the wall back of it.
The killer whirled and flung the fourth shot at the
man behind the bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that garrulous youth was fleeing wildly for
safety. He had no intention whatever of being
Number Fifteen. Between him and the back door
was a table. He took it in his stride with all the
ease of a champion hurdler. Down the alley he
went like a tin-canned cur with a mob of small boys
behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inside of ten minutes Piodie knew that Sam
Dutch was on the warpath again and that no man
who did not want a permanent home on Boot Hill
would be wise to mention posters or bowie knives to
him. Piodie made a good many guesses as to the
truth of the situation. Something had taken place
that the town knew nothing about. The poster,
Dutch’s battered face, his rage, and the absence of his
bowie knife from its accustomed sheath in the man’s
boot, all bore some relation to the mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is this Hugh McClintock, anyhow?” asked a
citizen newly arrived from Ohio. “Anybody know
anything about him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Irish Tom Carberry grinned. He was at the post
office getting his mail when the innocent question
drifted to him. He looked at the stranger. “Sam
Dutch knows him. So do I. We know him domn
well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave no further information, but after he had
gone another former resident of Aurora whispered
advice to the Ohioan. “Better not be so curious in
public, friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because there’s liable to be a killin’ before night.
Don’t you see McClintock has served notice on
Dutch that he can’t be chief of Piodie while he’s
here? It’s up to Sam to make good or shut up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All I asked was——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We done heard what you asked. It ain’t
etiquette in Nevada to ask questions unless you aim
to take a hand in the play. You ain’t declarin’
yoreself in, are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bet your boots I’m not. None of my business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said something that time.” The former
Aurora man walked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man from the Western Reserve looked after
him resentfully. “This is the darndest place. I ask
a question, and you’d think I’d made a break of some
kind. Is there any harm in what I said? I leave
it to any of you. Is there?” he asked querulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Budd drew him aside and explained. “Hell’s
bells, man, don’t be so inquisitive! I knew a fellow
lived to be a hundred onct ’tendin’ to his own business.
But I’ll tell you who Hugh McClintock is,
since yore system is so loaded with why-fors and
who-is-hes. The Kid’s the man that ran Dutch
outa the Esmeralda country. He’s the man whose
vote saved Irish Tom from being hanged when the
stranglers got busy at Aurora. He’s the shotgun
messenger who bumped off Black Hank Perronoud
when he held up the Carson stage. No gamer man
ever threw leg over leather. I’d oughta know, for he
rode pony express for me two years through the
Indian country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are he and Dutch going to fight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great jumpin’ Jehosophat, how do I know?”
rasped the fat man irritably. “I’m no tin god on
wheels, an’ I ain’t no seventh son of a seventh son.
If I was I’d go locate me a million-dollar mine <span class='it'>pronto</span>.
You know the layout well as I do. Do yore own
guessin’, an’ <span class='it'>do it private</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch whispered a word in the ears of his satellites
Vance and Hopkins later in the day. Those two
gentlemen made together a tour of the town and tore
down all the bills McClintock had tacked up.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch19'>CHAPTER XIX</h1></div>

<h3>McCLINTOCK BILLS THE TOWN</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>ugh’s</span> advertisement did not appear in the
<span class='it'>Banner</span> next morning. The editor had killed
it as soon as he learned that its purpose was
to annoy Dutch. He knew several safer amusements
than that. Young McClintock might enjoy flirting
with death, but as the responsible head of a family
the editor was in quite a different position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To say that Hugh was enjoying himself is to stretch
the truth. But experience had taught him that the
bold course is sometimes the least hazardous. A
line from a play he had seen at Piper’s Opera House
not long since flashed to his mind. “Out of this
nettle danger, we pluck this flower safety.” He
would go through, if necessary, to a fighting finish.
The chances were that his scorn of risk would lessen
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accompanied by his faithful coloured bill sticker,
Hugh redecorated the town with posters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Budd came wheezing down Turkey Creek
Avenue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You billin’ the town for a circus, Kid?” he asked,
his fat paunch shaking. And when Hugh had stepped
forward to him he added a warning in a lower
voice: “Dutch is waitin’ for you in front of Dodsons’
store; least, it looks to me like he’s aimin’ to
call yore hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any one with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hopkins and Bob Dodson. I kinda figured they
were lookout men for him. Say, you don’t have to
play a lone hand. I’d as lief sit in. Byers, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Jim. My hand’s stronger if I play it alone.
Much obliged, just the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Budd conceded this as a matter of principle, but
he was reluctant to do so in practice. “Well, don’t
you get careless, Kid. Dutch is sudden death with a
gun. Sure is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Opposite Dodson &amp; Dodson’s Emporium was the
Mammoth Saloon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tack one on the door, Uncle Ned,” said Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock spoke without looking at the bill
sticker. He was watching three men standing in
front of the store opposite. One of these hastily
retreated inside. The two who remained were
Dutch and Hopkins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The killer growled a warning. “Lay off on that
bill stickin’. It don’t go here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh stepped across the street. He moved
evenly and without haste. “Well, well, if it ain’t
Sam Dutch, chief of Virginia and Aurora, just as big
as life and as handsome. Lemme see, you were
takin’ the Candelabria stage last time I saw you.”
Smilingly the young man began to hum, “Git out de
way, ole Dan Tucker.” But the smile was of the
lips only. His steely eyes held those of the big
ruffian fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A snarling sound that might have been an oath
fell from the ugly lips of the gun-fighter. His face
reflected his slow thoughts. Should he strike now?
He knew that a dozen men were waiting for the
sound of a shot, that they expected him to kill
McClintock on sight. Well, he would kill him all
right—soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without lifting his eyes for an instant from his
enemy, Hugh gave the old Negro the order a second
time: “Nail up the bill, Uncle. Mr. Dutch is
joking. You <span class='it'>are</span> joking, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch glared at Hugh furiously. He moistened
his dry lips with his tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the left boot leg McClintock drew a bowie
knife. The horn handle was marked in a peculiar
way. Hugh had shown it to a dozen men, and most
of them had recognized it. One of the pleasant
habits of Dutch was to play with it threateningly
before a fascinated circle of reluctant admirers.
Now the young man held it up in his left hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m tryin’ to find an owner for this knife. Happen
to know him, Mr. Dutch?” The straight, swift
probe of the eyes was cold as iron, hard as hammered
brass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a call for a showdown. The men watching
from the store windows, from the saloon opposite,
from the blacksmith shop below, knew that a demand
had been made on Dutch for a declaration of intentions.
In the silence which followed, men suspended
their breathing. The shadow of death hung low
over the two tense figures standing out in relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afterwards those present spoke of the contrast
between the sullen sodden killer and the erect,
soldierly athlete facing him. The guttural snarl, the
great slouching apelike figure of the one suggested
a throwback to prehistoric days. The clear expressive
eyes, the unconscious grace and nobility of
carriage, the quiet confidence of manner in the other
were products of a new land flowering to manhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men breathed again. Their hearts functioned
normally once more. Dutch had chosen to dodge
the challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno as I know more about him than anybody
else,” he had growled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh did not relax the thrust of his eyes. “No?
Thought maybe you did. I found it at the storage
warehouse, corner of the alley, up the avenue.
Didn’t leave it there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch did not answer at once. Inside, he surged
with murderous impulse. He might beat this fellow
McClintock to the draw. He had always boasted
that he wanted no more than an even break with any
man alive. Well, he had it here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who says I left it there?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m asking if you did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The killer’s right hand hung motionless. A weight
paralyzed his will. These McClintocks had the
Indian sign on him. Deep in him a voice whispered
that if he accepted the challenge he was lost. Better
wait and get this fellow right when he had no
chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No-o.” To Dutch it seemed that the husky
monosyllable was dragged out of him by some external
force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tauntingly the cold voice jeered him. “Not you,
then, that bushwhacked me in the alley and tried to
shoot me in the back? Wouldn’t do that, would
you, Dutch? Got all yore fourteen on the level, of
course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I aim to—to give every man a show,” the gunman
muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good of you. Then it couldn’t have been you
that threw this knife at me and tried to gun me. It
was dark. I couldn’t make out his face, but I left
the marks of my fist on it a-plenty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that it seemed there was to be no gun-play
the watchers had come into the open. A battery of
eyes focussed on the hammered face of Dutch. Cut
lips, a black eye, purple weals on the forehead, and
swollen cheeks told of recent punishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fell down a prospect hole,” the bad man mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bark of laughter, quickly smothered, met this
explanation. Dutch glared round angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That prospect hole must have landed on you
hard,” Hugh told him grimly. “Take my advice.
<span class='it'>Don’t fall down any more.</span> Next time the shaft
might shoot a hole through you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t scared of you none. You can’t run on
me,” Dutch growled sulkily, to save his face. “One
o’ these days I’m liable to get tired of you and feed
you to the buzzards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know you’re chief here, same as you were
at Virginia and Aurora. But just to show there’s no
hard feelings you’ll help Uncle Ned tack up that
poster, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Dutch’s sullen eyes battled and were beaten.
“I don’t have to,” he flung out rebelliously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” Hugh mocked. “But out of good
will you’ll do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ruffian shuffled across the road, snatched a
bill from the old Negro, and with a hammer drove a
tack through the middle of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the Mammoth walked a big well-dressed
man without a hat. He had black glossy hair and a
small black moustache. In his manner and bearing
was that dominance which comes to those who are
successful. With a glance he took in the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tear that bill down, Dutch,” he said crisply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bad man looked at him, then at McClintock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh laughed. “You hear yore master’s voice,
Dutch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch ripped the bill down and tore it into a dozen
pieces. Released from the mastery that had held
him, he broke into savage furious oaths. At a word
from the black-eyed man he would have fought it out
with his enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ralph Dodson did not speak the word. His
frowning attention was fixed on Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. McClintock, the Mammoth is owned by me
and my brother. If we want bills on the walls we’ll
put them there. Understand?” he demanded arrogantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh bowed, almost as mockingly and as gracefully
as Scot himself could have done it. “Quite.
My fault, Mr. Dodson. I’ll explain. This knife
was sheathed two nights ago in my arm. A scoundrel
waited for me in a dark alley and tried to murder
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Interesting, no doubt, but not my business,”
retorted Dodson curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I’m puttin’ up posters to find the owner of the
knife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not here. You can’t put ’em up here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not necessary. Everybody here knows who owns
the knife—or rather who did own it. It’s mine now,
unless someone claims it. That all right with you,
Dutch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The killer said nothing, but he said it with bloodshot,
vindictive eyes—eyes in which hate and fear and
cunning and the lust to kill struggled for victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh turned on his heel and walked away, the
sound of his footsteps sharp and ringing. Not once
did he look back to see whether the murderer he had
discredited would shoot him in the back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet he was glad when he was out of range. Experiments
in the psychology of a killer might easily
be carried too far.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch20'>CHAPTER XX</h1></div>

<h3>“LITTLE VICKY”</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>J</span>im Budd</span> had a dozen reasons to offer why there
must be gold in Bald Knob. Like many others,
he was letting his hopes influence his judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had finished his argument Hugh grinned.
“May be here. May not. A fifty to one bet I’d
call it, us on the short end. But that’s mining. No
can tell. Might as well stick up our notice here as
anywhere. What say, Dan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byers said, “Suits me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about this fellow Singlefoot Bill who took
up the claims originally—sure he’s outa the country
and won’t make a kick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Handed in his checks last year at Austin. Anyhow,
he never did any assessment work here. You
can see that. Just filed his location notice and let
it go at that,” Budd explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t he patent any of his claims?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon. But not these. He couldn’t have.
There’s not been enough work done on the ground.
He jest scratched around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he patented there would be a record of it, of
course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t so sure of that, either. The house where
they used to keep the county papers burned down in
the big fire a coupla years ago more or less.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the recorder would know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he died a month since. But we’re in the
clear. All you got to do is to use yore eyes to see
this land couldn’t a-been patented.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh used his eyes and they corroborated his
friend’s opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The partner surveyed roughly the claims they decided
on, drove in corner stakes, and put up their
announcements of ownership. Four locations were
taken in partnership. Each of them filed on several
individual claims. Hugh took one in his brother’s
name, the rest in his own. One of these last was
to be held in trust for Vicky until she became of age.
It was a custom of the country to take up mining
prospects for friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh wrote the notice for the partners. It read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>We, the undersigned, claim four claims of 300 feet each in this
silver and gold bearing quartz lead, or lode, extending north and
south from this notice, with all its dips, spurs, angles, and variations,
together with 50 feet of ground on either side for working
the same.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Each of the three signed the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similar location notices were posted on the individual
claims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh took charge of operations. He hired men,
bought tools and supplies, selected the spot for the
shaft, and himself tossed out the first shovel of dirt.
When operations were under way he turned the
management over to his partners and returned
to Virginia City.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The business of the firm called him. Incidentally,
he wanted to see his week-old nephew, Alexander
Hugh McClintock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went directly to his brother’s house on A
Street. At his knock the door was opened by a
young woman. She was dark and slender, and at
sight of him her eyes flashed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re Mr. Hugh McClintock,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. You’re the nurse, I suppose. How is
Mollie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The face of the young woman held surprises.
Mischief bubbled over it for a moment. “Yes, I’m
the nurse. Would you like to see—Mrs. McClintock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I may.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nurse led the way into the house. Presently,
after disappearing for a minute into Mollie’s room,
she returned for Hugh. He trod softly, as men do
in the presence of sickness or some mystery of life or
death that awes them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie had never looked lovelier. A faint pink of
apple blossoms fluttered into her cheeks. In the
crook of her arm lay Alexander Hugh McClintock, a
red and wrinkled little morsel of humanity. She
smiled with such a radiance of motherhood that the
man’s bachelor heart registered a pang of envy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Hugh, I’m so happy,” she whispered as he
kissed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s fine—fine,” he said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We named him after your father and you.
Scot would have it, wouldn’t he, Vicky?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dark young woman nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh felt the flush dyeing his face. “Little
Vicky!” he stammered. “Why, I thought——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you for the dolls, kind sir,” she said, and
curtsied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt like a fool. How long was it since he had
sent her a black doll baby?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you were still a little girl,” he blurted.
“Nobody told me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—that little girls grow up. They do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t be more than fourteen—or fifteen,”
he charged, trying to escape from his mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going on seventeen, sir,” she said demurely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your letter——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—was from a little girl to whom you sent a nigger
doll.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said in it——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said thank you for the doll. Wasn’t it a proper
letter for a little girl to write to a kind gentleman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She asked it with a manner of naïve innocence,
hardly a hint of mirth in the dark, long-lashed eyes
meeting his so directly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie laughed. “She wrote and asked us not to
tell you she had grown up, Hugh. We wondered
when you would guess she wasn’t any longer a child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been several kinds of an idiot in my time, but
this—this takes the cake,” Hugh said ruefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Victoria relented. She held out her
hand impulsively. Her smile was warm and kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mind my little joke, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit. I brought it on myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you want to know, I thought it was dear of you
to remember the little girl away at school alone.”
A faint shell pink beat into the clear satiny cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I liked that little girl. She had a lot of git-up-an’-git.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky laughed. “She was a terror, if that’s what
you mean. Always in mischief. Mollie will tell you
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but she was a tender-hearted little cyclone,”
smiled the older sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot came into the room. “ ’Lo, Hugh,” he said.
“When’d you get back?” Without waiting for an
answer he passed to the bed upon which were his
wife and his firstborn. Lightly his hand caressed
her soft hair. “Everything right, Mollie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes rested happily in his. “Everything in
the world, Scot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This nurse I got for you treating you proper?”
With a motion of his head he indicated Victoria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s spoiling me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. H. McClintock behaving himself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s an angel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed her. “Must take after his father then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope he does. He looks like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot laughed, and with a touch of embarrassment
turned to his brother. “You see what you’ll be
letting yourself in for when you marry, Hugh. Got
to walk a straight and narrow line to keep your wife
fooled about you. And for a reward she’ll tell you
that a red wrinkled little skeezicks looks like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s the dearest little baby I ever saw,” protested
Vicky warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot poked a forefinger at the midriff of his heir.
“I kind of like the little grasshopper myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know very well you’re <span class='it'>crazy</span> about him,”
Vicky answered triumphantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie only smiled. It was not necessary for her
any longer to reassure herself about Scot’s love.
She knew him. The days of her doubts were past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Scot left the bedside and sat down on the
arm of a big chair. “How’s Piodie, Hugh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One live camp,” the younger brother answered.
“Plenty of room for us there. We can put an outfit
in and get all the teaming we want. One objection
is that the Dodsons run the camp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Run it how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Own the biggest store, the stamp mills, a controlling
interest in the best producing mines, the
stage line, half the town site, and the sheriff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything else?” asked Scot with a dry smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bunch of thugs and the courts. Our old friend
Sam Dutch is their handy man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see Dutch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We met,” Hugh answered briefly. “I bumped
into Jim Budd and Dan Byers, too. They’re runnin’
a feed corral there. We located a bunch of prospects
together. I wrote you about that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Took up one in yore name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And one in trust for Vicky, you said in the letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh flushed to the roots of his hair. He turned
to the girl. “A part of that fool mistake of mine.
I kinda thought it might turn out a good prospect
and if so you’d have it when you grew up. I didn’t
aim to—to overstep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Victoria had been listening eagerly to every word
they had said. She had her own reasons for being
interested in Piodie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you didn’t. It was for that wild little
Vicky you used to know. I’ll thank you for her, but
of course I can’t keep a claim you took up for me on
a misunderstanding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would. Not likely it’ll amount to
anything. But we’ve got more than we can work
now. You’re welcome as the sun in May.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think that’s <span class='it'>really</span> true—about his not
wanting it?” Vicky asked Scot. “I’d like to take
it if—if you folks can’t use it. But I’m not going
to rob you and him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d take it, Vicky,” Scot told her. “Chances
are we’ll never do the assessment work on our own
claims. We’re not miners—not by business. Hugh
has all he can handle without yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to Hugh with a brisk little nod of the
dark head. “Then I’ll take it—and thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will you do with it now you have it?”
Mollie asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do the assessment work—have a shaft dug,”
answered Vicky. “I have four hundred dollars
left of the Virginia Dodson Fund, and, dear people,
I’m going to begin earning more week after next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” asked her sister, surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been asked to teach school at Piodie and I
accepted to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie protested, and knew that her protest was
in vain. Her young sister was compact of energy.
It expressed itself in the untamed joyous freedom
of her rhythmic tread, in the vitality of the spirit
emanating from the light erect figure of the bright-eyed
vestal. If she had made up her mind to go to
Piodie to teach, there would be no stopping her.
All Mollie could do would be to see through Scot
that the girl had a good boarding place where she
would be properly looked after.</p>

<h3>IN THE BLIZZARD</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he McClintocks</span> decided after all not to put
in a freight outfit to Piodie. The Dodsons
beat them to it by putting in a large number
of wagons as adjuncts to the stages they ran from
Carson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Hugh’s partners word came at intervals of
the progress made in sinking the shaft of the Ground
Hog, which was the name they had given the mine.
These messages reflected Budd’s enthusiasm. The
postscript of each of them, whether it came in the
form of a letter or a word-of-mouth greeting, was to
the effect that he expected to strike the ledge now at
any time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wrote in one note:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Bald Knob is sure looking up. Ralph Dodson has done made
some locations above us, and two lads from American Flat of
the name of Jenson have staked out a claim just below us down
the hill. They’re running a tunnel in from the hillside. Well,
Kid, look out for news of a big strike soon. We’re sure right
close to the vein, looks like.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh smiled when he read it. Budd had been on
the verge of a discovery so many times that his non-resident
partner discounted the prophecy. There
was no use in building up hopes that would probably
never be realized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another letter the fat man mentioned a second
piece of news. “Our schoolmarm here, Miss Victoria
Lowell, has begun scratching dirt right lively
on that claim you staked out for her. She has got a
Swede on the job, but she has been out ’most every
Saturday to see how tricks are. I notice Ralph
Dodson has been mighty attentive to her. <span class='it'>You
better drift over, Kid, and do your assessment work on
that claim if you aim to get it patented in your name.</span>
Me, if I was a high-stepping colt like you, I’ll be doggoned
if I’d let that smooth guy Dodson jump as
rich a prospect as the Little Schoolmarm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time Hugh did not smile. Budd, of course,
was on the wrong track. He had leaped to the
conclusion that Hugh was in love with the girl because
he had staked a claim for her, and in his blunt
blundering way he was giving his friend a tip.
McClintock was troubled. He profoundly distrusted
Ralph Dodson, had disliked him from the first moment
when their eyes met. The fellow was a ravening
wolf if he had ever seen one. But he was handsome,
well-dressed, the kind of man who is like wildfire
among women. He probably knew how to make love
amazingly well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Vicky—impetuous, imperious little Vicky of
the brave heart and generous instincts—was just the
girl to yield to the glamour of his charm. He could
see now her flashing face, finely cut like a rare brilliant,
full of fire and high lights. She had better be
dead than the wife of Ralph Dodson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thing worried him. It would not let him
alone. At work and in his leisure hours he thought of
the girl with keen-edged anxiety. His imagination
began to play him tricks. At dusk, as he walked to
his room, he would see her filmily in front of him,
moving like sweet music toward the open arms of
Dodson. Once she turned and gave Hugh her cryptic,
tantalizing smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Someone ought to interfere to save the girl from
an event so ruinous. He thought of telling Scot,
but after all he had nothing better to go on than the
gossip of old Jim Budd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On swift impulse he decided to go to Piodie himself.
It would not do any harm, anyhow, to have a look
at the Ground Hog and see how it was developing.
While he was there maybe he could drop a casual hint
to Vicky. Perhaps he would discover that Budd’s
warning was all moonshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Winter was white on the hills when Hugh started
over the Geiger Grade to Reno by stage. At Reno
he found traffic tied up. The snow in the valleys
was deep and it drifted with the wind so fast that
the cuts filled up and prevented the stage from getting
through. Hugh learned that a pack train had
broken trail the day before and had reached Stampede
Notch in safety. From there it was working
across the divide to Piodie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bought a pair of snowshoes and set out on the
long trip. The day was warm and the snow soft.
This made travel difficult, and McClintock made
slow progress until he was out of the Truckee
Meadows. By afternoon he was in the hills. The
wind was whistling in gusts, sometimes wrathfully,
again in a plaintive whine. It was colder now and
the snow less slushy. In spite of fatigue he covered
the miles faster than he had been able to do in the
valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many times he glanced at the sky uneasily. It
was heavy with dun clouds, and unless he missed his
guess snow would fall soon and in quantity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Came dusk, and after dusk darkness. Hugh kept
going. He was an old-timer and could tell his direction
by the wind, the dip of the land, and the slope
of the snow waves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was nearly midnight when he knocked at the
door of a Mormon ranch house and asked shelter for
the night. Healthily fatigued in every muscle, he
slept like a schoolboy almost round the clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he took the road again it was noon. At
intervals during the night snow had fallen, but just
now the storm had died down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better stay another night,” the rancher advised.
“Gettin’ her back up for a blizzard, looks like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The taste of the air and the look of the sky backed
his prophecy. There was going to be more snow and
a lot of it. Very likely there would be snow and
wind together. But Hugh did not want to be tied up
for several days in the hills. He decided to make a
dash for Piodie. The town was not more than
twenty-five miles away. If his luck held he would
be in by supper time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had covered half the distance before the storm
hit him hard. It began with wind, heavy sweeping
gusts of it driving over the hills and into the ravines.
Presently snow came, a hard sleet that pelted his
face like ground glass. The temperature was falling
fast. Hugh set his teeth and ploughed forward,
putting his head down into the blizzard as a football
player does when he is bucking the line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young and warm-blooded though he was, the chill
of the tempest bit to his bones and sapped his vitality.
The wind and the fine sleet were like a wall
that pressed closely and savagely on him. Now
and again he raised his head and took the full fury
of the leaping storm to make sure that he was still
on the trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far and near became relative words. The end of
the world, as far as he could tell, was almost within
reach of his outstretched hand. The whistle of the
shrieking wind was so furious that it deadened all
sounds, even itself. The sleety snow was a silent
stinging foe that flogged him mile after mile as he
wallowed on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The afternoon had been dark, but an added murkiness
told him that night was at hand. He was
nearly exhausted, and in the darkness, with the
raging blizzard all about him, he felt that directions
would become confused. He must be close to town
now, but if he should get lost, a quarter of a mile
would be as far away as Carson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And presently he knew that he was lost. He was
staggering through the deep snow on a hillside.
Somehow he had got off the trail and it was swallowed
up in the bleak night. He had an extraordinary
store of strength, vitality, and courage. But it
was not in human endurance to stand up under the
flailing of the wind and sleet that pelted him, to
keep going through the heavy drifts that had been
swept into every hollow and draw. The bitter cold
penetrated closer to his heart. An overpowering
desire to lie down and sleep tugged at his will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not for a moment did he give up. One of his
snowshoes was lost in a snow bank. He kicked off
the other. Now on his hands and knees, now on his
feet, weaving forward like a drunken man, all sense
of direction gone, he still plunged into the howling
waste of desolation that hemmed him in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He followed the path of least resistance. It took
him down hill into a draw. His stumbling steps
zigzagged toward a lower level and he followed the
arroyo to its mouth. A slight dip in the ground
swung him to the right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His boots were clogged with snow. The muscles
of his thighs were so weary that each time he dragged
a leg out of the drifts it felt as though weighted with
a cannon ball. There were times when he could
make ground only by throwing his body forward and
beating down the white bank that obstructed the
way. Still he crawled on, an indomitable atom
of fighting humanity in a great frozen desert of
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A groping hand struck something solid. The stiff
fingers of the hand searched the surface of the barrier.
Hugh’s heart renewed hope. He had come up
against a pile of corded wood. It was cut in short
lengths to fit a stove. The chances were that
somewhere within fifty feet of him was a house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But where? In what direction? The fury of the
storm filled the night, made it opaque as a wall. He
could not see five feet in front of him. The landmark
that he had found he dared not leave, for if he
wandered from it the chances were that he would
never find it again. It would be of no use to shout.
The shrieking wind would drown a voice instantly.
Yet he did call out, again and again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thing he did was born of the necessity of the
situation. He dug aside the snow from the top of
the pile and with a loose piece of wood hammered
free others from the niche into which they were
frozen. How he did this he could never afterwards
tell, for his muscles were so paralyzed from cold that
they would scarcely answer the call his will made on
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, hard and straight, he flung a stick out into
the storm. His reserves of strength were nearly
gone, but he held himself to the job before him.
One after another he threw the pieces of firewood,
following a definite plan as to direction, in such a
way as to make the place where he stood the centre of
a circle. His hope was to strike the house. If he
could do this, and if the door happened to be on the
side of the house nearest him, then the light of the
lamp would perhaps penetrate into the storm so that
he could see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew it was a gamble with all the odds against
him. He was backing a series of contingencies each
one of which must turn in his favour if he was to win.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He collapsed on the woodpile at last from sheer
physical exhaustion. For a few moments he lay
there, helpless, drifting toward that sleep from which
he would never awake in this world. But the will
to live still struggled feebly. He was of that iron
breed which has won the West for civilization against
untold odds. It was not in him to give up as long
as he could force his tortured body forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even now he did not forget the craft of the
frontiersman which reads signs and makes deductions
from them. The corded wood was two lengths
deep. Near one end there was a sag in it two or three
feet deep. This depression was greater on the side
next Hugh. He reasoned that it is human nature to
choose the easiest way. The people who lived in the
house would use first that part of the wood which
was nearest. Therefore it followed that the house
must be on the same side of the corded pine as
he was, and it must be closest to the place from
which the wood had been carried to the kitchen stove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He struck out at a right angle from the pile. Before
he had gone three steps he stumbled and fell.
His prostration was so complete that he could not at
once get to his feet again. He lay inert for a time,
then crawled up again and lurched forward. A
second time his knees buckled under him. As he
fell, an outstretched hand hit the wall of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Weakly he felt his way along the wall till he came
to a door. His hand fumbled with the latch, but his
frozen fingers could not work the catch. He beat
on the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It opened unexpectedly, and he plunged forward
to the floor of the cabin. He saw, as though a long
way off, the faces of devils and of angels lit by high
lights. His body lost weight, and he floated into
space luxuriously. Pain and fatigue, devils and
angels, all were blotted out.</p>

<h3>A HAVEN OF REFUGE</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>V</span>icky</span> was enjoying herself tremendously.
All her young life she had been chaperoned
and directed. Teachers had watched over
and instructed her. She had better do this; it was
not ladylike to do that. The right kind of a girl
could not be too careful what she did and how she did
it. The sweet demureness of watchful waiting was
the only proper attitude of a nice young woman
toward that important and vital business of getting
married. So much she had learned at school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It happened that Vicky did not want to get married—not
yet, at any rate. She wanted to try her
own wings. She wanted to flutter out into the world
and see what it was like.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already she had made experiments and discoveries.
One of them was that if you smiled in the right way
when you asked for it you could get anything you
wanted from men. She had wanted a globe and
some new seats for the schoolroom, and the
directors had voted them cheerfully even though the
district was short of funds. Jim Budd had spent
two hours building some bookshelves she needed
for her bedroom, just because she had said pretty
please to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Mrs. Budd was different. She liked Victoria
and fed her well and saw that she wore her heavy
coat when it was cold, but the young woman understood
that smiles would not have the least effect on
any of that plump mother’s decisions. In this
Mrs. Budd was like the rest of her sex. They did
not go out of their way to please you because you
were a—well, a not exactly plain girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The experiments of the young school teacher were
innocent enough. She was not by nature a coquette.
But the world was her oyster, and she meant to have
a perfectly delightful time prying it open. She
found that there were a good many people, at least
fifty per cent. of whom were of the masculine gender,
ready to lend a hand at operating on the bivalve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the most assiduous was Ralph Dodson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky discouraged his attentions. For one thing,
he was the brother of a man she had detested all her
life. She did not want to have anything whatever to
do with a Dodson. After what had taken place it
was not decent that the families should have any
relationship at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she found Ralph Dodson not easily disheartened.
He did not lay himself open to a direct snub.
A member of the board had properly introduced him
to her. If he came out of a store as she was going
down the street and walked a block beside her she
could hardly rebuff him. Before she had been at
Piodie a month, the clerk of the school district retired
and Dodson was appointed in his place. This
annoyed her, because she now had to see a good deal
of him; but she could not very well accuse him of
having brought about the change merely for that
purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky found herself studying the man. She looked
in him for the same traits that had made her as a
child hate his brother. It irritated her that she did
not find them. Ralph Dodson was strong, competent,
energetic. She would have liked to discover
him mean, but instead she uncovered in his view a
largeness of vision in civic affairs that surprised her.
He believed in good schools even though they cost
money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One flaw she found in him. He had kept out of
the army during the war and made money while
Scot and Hugh were fighting for the Union. But this
was true of many men in the far West, which was a
long way from the fighting line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day an accident took place that increased her
unwilling admiration of him. Near the schoolhouse
was an abandoned mine tunnel, poorly timbered, in
which she had forbidden the children to play.
Little Johnny Haxtun, playing hide and seek, ventured
into it and in the darkness stumbled against a
rotten post. At his weight the support crumbled.
There was a cave-in, and Johnny lay crushed beneath
a mass of rock and timber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the first of the rescuers to arrive was Ralph
Dodson. He told the young school teacher, who
was standing there white and shaken, to get a doctor
and have first-aid relief at hand in case Johnny
should be alive when he was released.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, axe in hand, he led the men into the tunnel.
It was dangerous work. The fallen timbering had
to be cut and dug away. At any moment an
avalanche of rock and dirt might pour down from
above and kill them all. Dodson did not shirk. He
stood up to his job deep in the tunnel, regardless of
the little slides trickling down that might at any
instant precipitate a hundred tons upon him. The
worst of it was that the more dirt and jammed timbers
were removed, the greater the peril of a second
cave-in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Johnny was still alive. A couple of crossed timbers
had protected him from the weight of rock and
dirt. Vicky heard his whimpering and came into
the tunnel to comfort him. But Dodson would have
none of that. He ordered the girl into the open instantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This isn’t a woman’s job. Get out,” he told her
curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps she resented his manner at the moment,
but when half an hour later he emerged from the
tunnel carrying the maimed body of the little
fellow she forgot her pique. The man’s hands were
torn and bleeding, his face stained with sweat and
streaks of dirt. The clothes of which he was usually
so careful were daubed with yellow clay. She remembered
only that he had risked his life to save
Johnny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor could she forget it when he called that evening
at her boarding house, ostensibly to tell her that the
doctor had set Johnny’s broken leg and found no
other injury from the accident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s going to be hard on his mother. You know
she’s a widow and takes in washing,” Vicky said. “I
wonder if we couldn’t give a school entertainment
for her benefit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t be necessary,” he said promptly. “It’s
partly my fault the accident happened. As school
clerk I should have had the mouth of the tunnel
boarded up. I’m going to pay all the bills and see
that Mrs. Haxtun doesn’t lose anything by it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Victoria felt a glow at her heart. It always did her
good to find out that people were kinder and more
generous than she had supposed. Her judgment of
Ralph Dodson had been that he was hard and selfish.
Now she was ashamed of herself for thinking so. She
thought of the “Greater love than this” verse, and in
her soul she humbled herself before him. What a
little prig she had been to set herself up as arbiter of
right and wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dodson made the most of the opportunity chance
had given him. He used it as a wedge to open up a
friendship with the girl. She was still reluctant,
but this was based on some subconscious impulse.
All the fine generosity in her was in arms to be fair
to him regardless of his brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as he learned that she had a claim on Bald
Knob that she wanted to develop Dodson put his
experience at her service. He helped her arrange with
a man to do the actual assessment work and he went
over the ground with her to choose the spot for the
shaft. Afterwards he kept an eye on Oscar Sorenson
to see that he did a fair day’s work for the pay he
received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On holidays Vicky usually walked or rode out to
her claim to see how Sorenson was getting along.
She was pretty apt to meet Dodson on the way to
Bald Knob or else superintending operations there.
Two or three times he came down to her prospect at
noon and they strolled up a little gulch to pick wild
flowers and eat their lunch together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew so much more about the world than she
did that she found his talk interesting. The glimpse
she had had of San Francisco had whetted her appetite.
Were other cities like the one by the Golden
Gate, gay and full of life and fashion which young
girls at a finishing school were not permitted to see?
He told her of London and Paris and Vienna, and her
innocent credulity accepted what he said at face
value. He had the gift of talk, the manner of a man
of the world. From the confident ease of his descriptions
she could not guess that he had never been
in Paris or Vienna and only once in London for a
flying visit to float a mining scheme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll not be going to the mine to-day, dearie,”
Mrs. Budd said to Vicky one Saturday morning when
the hills were white with a blanket of snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I promised Oscar to bring his mail and
some tobacco. Besides, I want to see how he’s been
getting along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you take my advice you’ll stay comfy at home
and not go traipsing all over the hills gettin’ your
feet an’ your skirts wet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the things Vicky rarely did was to accept
advice and follow it. A fault of her years and of her
temperament was that she had to gain her wisdom
through experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love to get out in the snow and tramp in it,”
Vicky said cheerfully, helping herself to another hot
biscuit. “And I’ll not get wet if I wear arctics and
tuck up my skirts when I’m out of town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hmp! If you’re set on it you’ll go. I know that
well enough. But you’ll come home early, won’t
you? There’s a lot more snow up in the sky yet,
and by night we’re likely to have some of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky promised. When she struck the trail to
Bald Knob she discovered that the snow was deeper
than she had supposed. But there was a well-beaten
track as far as the shoulder of the ridge. Beyond
that she had to break a path for herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was heavy work. She grew tired long before she
reached the mine. But she kept going rather than
turn back. It was nearly two o’clock when Sorenson
answered her hail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky did not stay long at the mine. She did not
like the look of the sky. The wind was rising, too,
and the temperature falling. Once she thought of
asking Sorenson to go back to town with her, but
she scouted the idea promptly and dismissed it. It
did not agree with her view of the self-reliance she
was cultivating. Incidentally, too, Sorenson was a
lazy, sulky fellow who would resent taking any unnecessary
trouble. She did not want to put herself
under an obligation to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind had sifted a good deal of snow into the
tracks she had made on the way down from the
shoulder of the hill. It came now in great swirling
gusts, filling the air with the light surface snow. By
the time she had passed the Dodson properties the
wind had risen to a gale, a biting wintry hurricane
that almost lifted her from her feet. A stinging sleet
swept into her face and blinded her. She found it
difficult to make out the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before she reached the foot of the slope below Bald
Knob she was very tired. The wind drifts had
filled the path, so that she had to break her own
trail. The fury of the storm was constantly increasing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the comparative shelter of a little draw she
stopped to decide what she had better do. It was
still a mile and a half to town. She did not believe
she could possibly make it even if she did not lose
the way. Nor could she climb Bald Knob again to
the Dodson camp. That would not be within her
power. There was a little cabin in the next draw
where Ralph slept when he did not care to go to
town after spending the day on his Bald Knob property.
It was usually stocked with supplies of food
and fuel. No doubt it would be unoccupied now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her head down into the white blizzard
and trudged round the edge of the ridge that divided
the two small gulches. Three minutes later she
pushed open the door of the cabin and walked in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man sitting at a table jumped to his feet with a
startled oath. “Goddamighty, who are you?” he
demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky was as much taken aback as he. “I thought
the cabin was empty,” she explained. “I’m Victoria
Lowell, the school teacher at Piodie. I’ve been up
to my claim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s look was half a scowl and half a leer.
He was a big round-shouldered ruffian with long hair
and tangled, unkempt beard. There floated in her
mind a vague and fugitive recollection of having
seen him before somewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better dry yorese’f,” he said ungraciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the fireplace a big twisted piñon knot threw
out a glow of heat. The girl took off her coat, shook
the snow from the wet skirts, and moved forward to
absorb the warmth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her host pushed a chair toward her with his foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sank into it, worn out. Presently the moist
skirts began to steam and the warmth of the fire made
her drowsy. She aroused herself to conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry I had to trouble you. I was ’fraid I
couldn’t make it to town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell’v a day,” he agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the table were a whisky bottle and a glass.
He indicated them with a sweep of his hand. “Have
a nip. Warm you up, miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thanks. I’m all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over her stole a delightful lassitude, the reaction
from her fight with the storm. She looked sleepily
into the live coals. The howling of the storm outside
was deadened enough to make a sort of lullaby. Her
head began to nod and her eyelids closed. With a
start she brought herself awake again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t know I was so done up,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’S all right. Sleep if you want to, miss,” the
man told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not for an hour or more did she open her eyes
again. The table was set for a meal. A coffeepot
was heating on some coals and a black kettle
hung suspended from a crane above the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come an’ get it, miss,” the man said gruffly
when he saw that she was awake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky discovered that she was hungry. She drank
the coffee he poured out and ate the stew he ladled
from the kettle. He did not eat with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the storm would break I’d try to reach town,”
she said presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No chance. You stay here where you’re safe,
miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friends will worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was that?” the girl asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had heard a sound of something striking the
side of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prob’ly a limb flung by the wind. Never saw
such a night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Victoria shuddered. But for good fortune she
might have now been perishing in the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long do you think it will last?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t tell. Maybe till mo’ning. Maybe two-three
days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it couldn’t last that long,” the girl cried,
appalled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hmp! Guess you don’t know a Nevada blizzard.”
Again he looked at her, a leer on his heavy
face. “You’re liable to have to put up with old
Sam for quite a spell, missie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky did not answer. Her eyes were meeting his
and the blood crept into her cheeks. There was a
furtive sinister menace between his narrowed lips
that reminded her of a wolf creeping toward its kill.
She looked away, her heart hammering fast. What
sort of a creature was this man with whom she was
locked up a million miles away from all the safeguards
of society? In the glowing coals she found
no answer to that question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently she stole a sidelong look at him. He was
pouring a drink from the whisky bottle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” he said, lifting the glass toward her. He
tilted back his hairy throat and drained the tumbler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A heavy pounding on the door startled the drinker.
He listened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Victoria was at the door instantly. She flung it
open. A man lurched forward and crumpled up on
the floor.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch23'>CHAPTER XXIII</h1></div>

<h3>TWO PLUS ONE MAKES THREE</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>ith</span> a swift movement of her supple body
Vicky was on her knees beside the man.
She slipped an arm under his head. Icy
sleet encrusted his clothes. It clung in icicles to his
hair and eyebrows. It matted his lashes and small
Vandyke beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From her throat came an astonished little cry
of recognition. The man was Hugh McClintock.
Over her shoulder she called to the big man at the
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring me whisky and water—please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He brought it, then closed the door. Awkwardly
he stood above her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had a hell’v a close call,” he growled sulkily.
It did not suit him to entertain a second guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky let the whisky drop between the lips.
Presently Hugh opened his eyes. He smiled feebly
at her. Surprise wiped out the smile. “Little
Vicky,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ump-hu,” she nodded. Then, to the hulking
figure behind her, the girl gave order: “Help me carry
him nearer the fire. He’s ’most frozen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fellow shambled forward and stooped down.
As he did so his eyes fell on the face of the helpless
traveller. He ripped out a savage oath. With the
sweep of an arm he dragged the girl to her feet and
hurled her back to the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His fury struggled for expression. “Gotcha.
Gotcha good an’ right. I’m gonna stomp the life
outa you. Gona put my heel on yore throat an’
crack yore spine. Un’erstand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Victoria knew the ruffian now. A flash of memory
carried her back to a day in her childhood when she
had seen a horrible apelike figure standing over the
prostrate body of a man from which life had just
been violently ejected. She saw the same gargoyle
face, the same hulking muscle-bound shoulders and
long arms with hairy wrists projecting from the coat
sleeves. Her memory brought her a second picture
of the same incident. A smiling young fellow was
lifting her gently from the ground. His hand was
caressing her hair softly as he spoke. She recalled
even his words. “Run right along into the wagon
where yore dad is, li’l girl, an’ don’t turn yore
head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s arm rested on a shelf, in the same position
where it had fallen when she had been hurled
back. Her fingers touched something cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You first. Yore brother next,” the guttural voice
of Dutch went on, and the horrible malice of it
seemed unhuman. “I been waitin’ a mighty long
time, an’ I gotcha at last. Sure have. Thought
I was scared of you an’ that damned high-heeled
brother o’ yourn, did you? Me, I was settin’ back
an’ waitin’—waitin’ for my chance. An’ it’s come,
like I knew it would. Beg. Whine like a papoose.
It won’t do you no good, but go to it jest the same.
Hear me—before I turn you over an’ crack yore
backbone at the neck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His gloating was horrible. It sent chills through
Victoria’s blood. Her fingers spasmodically closed—on
the ivory handle of a revolver. The force of the
recoil had flung her hand into contact with the
revolver Dutch had tossed on the shelf a few hours
earlier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’tcha hear me? Beg me to let you go.
Crawl over an’ lick my boots. Maybe I’ll go easy
on you like you two dern fools done with me.” A
jangle of hideous laughter accompanied his words.
He kicked his opponent in the side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh looked at him steadily, without a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought you had the Injun sign on me, eh?
Both of you? Well, I’ll say right here there never
was a minute I was scared of either one of you—or
both. Me, I’m Sam Dutch, a sure enough killer.
An’ you—you’re Number Fifteen. Ole Dan Tucker’s
come to git his supper, an’ he ain’t too late,
neither.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was working himself up for murder. Soon his
passion would be boiling over. Then he would
strike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thought dominated Vicky, drove out all
others. She must save Hugh McClintock. She
forgot to be afraid, forgot to remember that this
scoundrel was the terror of Nevada. Noiselessly
she crept forward and pushed the revolver into his
back just below the shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you move I’ll shoot you,” she said hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stream of curses died in the fellow’s throat.
His jaw fell. Ludicrously his immature mind groped
with the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three slow taps rose from the floor. Dutch
gasped. Those taps had always heralded disaster
for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky drew a knife from his boot and a revolver
from the belt he was wearing. She dropped them on
the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walk to the door,” she ordered. “Go outside.
If you come in before I call you I’ll shoot holes in
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hardly recognized her own voice. There was
in it a new note. She knew that if he refused to go
she would kill him as she would a wolf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch whined. “You wouldn’t drive me into the
storm after I done took you in an’ fed you, miss.
There can’t any one live in that blizzard. I was
jest a-funnin’ about him. Jest my li’l way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” she told him inexorably. “Now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went. She closed the door behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock crept toward the fire. Vicky gathered
the weapons and put them down beside her. Then
she took one of his hands in hers and began to rub it
to restore circulation. She worked on the other
hand, on his ears, his face, his throat. She helped
him to take off his boots and in spite of his protests
massaged his frozen feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pain was intense as the circulation began to be
renewed in his body. He clamped his teeth to keep
back the groans. He walked up and down nursing
his hands and his ears. But not a sound came from
his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it’s awful,” Vicky comforted. “But the
pain’s a good sign. Soon as it’s gone you’ll be all
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He grinned. There was nothing to do but endure
until the circulation was fully restored. He beat the
back of his hands against the palms. If Dutch
should grow troublesome he might need the use of his
fingers shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fist beat on the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I let him in?” the girl asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh picked up one of the revolvers and crooked
his stiff forefinger over the trigger. He could make
out to use it at a pinch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, let him in,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky took the second revolver. The knife Hugh
thrust into one of his boot legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the girl opened the door Dutch slouched in.
He was covered from head to foot with frozen snow
and sleet. His venomous eyes slanted first at McClintock,
then at the young woman. The sullen
impotent hatred in his heart was plain enough to
send goose-quills down Vicky’s spine. She knew
that if ever he were top dog it would go hard with
her or Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man poured out half a tumbler of whisky and
drank it neat. He shuffled up to the fire, taking the
opposite side to the one occupied by his guests.
Silently he glared at them. But for the moment he
could do nothing. They were armed. He was not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Exhausted by his long battle with the storm, Hugh
could hardly keep his eyes open. His worn body
called for sleep. But with that wild beast crouched
five feet away he dared not relax his vigilance for a
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky whispered in his ear: “Cuddle down in the
chair and sleep a while. I’ll watch him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh shook his head. No, that would never do.
At some unexpected instant the killer would fling
his huge bulk on her and wrest the revolver from her
hand. Much as his system craved it, Hugh rejected
sleep as unsafe. He would stay awake and
protect her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even as he was firmly resolving this his eyelids
drooped. His head relaxed against the back of the
chair. He made an effort to throw off the drowsiness
pressing him down. It was a feeble and unsuccessful
one. Presently he was sound asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the summit of Bald Knob the storm swept
down with a roar. It hurled itself into the valley with
screams like those of a lost soul. It beat against the
hut in furious gusts, rattling the windows and shaking
the door like some living monster intent on destruction.
For hours its rage continued unabated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, from opposite sides of the fireplace,
the desperado and the girl watched each other. He
had a feral cunning. It had served to keep him alive
more than once when he seemed at the end of his
rope. Now he piled the fuel high in the stone chimney
and pretended to go to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The glow of the heat had the intended effect. It
formed an alliance with Vicky’s fatigue. She, too,
began to nod at last, her wariness lulled by the
stertorous breathing of the big huddled figure opposite.
The sense of responsibility was still active
in her mind. She decided afterwards that she must
have cat-napped, as drivers do on a long night trip,
now and again for a few seconds at a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From one of these she awakened with a start.
Dutch was tiptoeing toward her. Their eyes met.
He crouched for the leap as her fingers busied themselves
with the revolver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The roar of the explosion filled the cabin. The
weight of the plunging man flung Vicky to the floor.
She lay face down, breathless, oppressed by his huge
bulk. The six-shooter had gone clattering beyond
her reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weight lifted from her. She heard scuffling
feet and heavy grunts as she recovered the weapon
and fled to the wall. When she turned it was to see
the butt of a six-gun rising and falling. There was a
gasp, a groan, and one of the struggling figures sank
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The one still standing was Hugh McClintock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man on the floor writhed painfully, turned
over, and sank into quietude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you hurt?” Hugh asked Vicky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “I fell asleep. Lucky it was
no worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So did I. He was creeping on me when I woke.
Is—is he dead?” she asked, awed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No such luck. I tapped his bean with my gun.”
He stooped over the prostrate man and turned him
on his back. “Hello! Here’s a wound in his
shoulder. You must have hit him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I hope not,” Vicky cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at the big revolver with a face of horror
and threw it on the shelf where she had found it
some hours earlier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably saved my life,” Hugh told her quietly.
“And you haven’t killed him. He’ll be all right in a
week or two. Good work, Vicky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—didn’t know what I was doing,” she sobbed.
“My fingers just pressed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Best thing could have happened,” Hugh said
cheerfully. “He’ll not trouble us any more. Have
to dress the wound, though. If it makes you sick
to——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t,” she cried eagerly. “Let me help.
What can I do?” Her reaction was toward activity.
If she could help to look after the man she might
forget the awful thing she had by chance escaped
doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rummage through that drawer. Find clean
shirts or rags. Tear one into strips,” Hugh told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flew to the drawer and began tossing out
socks, woollen shirts, old gloves, a pipe, some “dog
leg” tobacco, a pack of cards, a few ore samples, and
a vest or two of fancy patterns. Near the bottom
she found a cotton shirt. This she ripped up for
bandages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock brought water and washed the wound.
His enemy permitted it, sulky as a sore bear. The
wounded man winced when Hugh tried, as gently
as possible, to locate the bullet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lay off o’ that,” he growled. “Doc Rogers’ll
find the pill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Expect you’re right about that,” Hugh agreed.
“He can follow the drift better than I can. Never
worked on that level before myself. Doc will sure
strike the ore when he digs for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky passed the bandages to him as he needed
them. He noticed once that the blood had washed
from her face and left it colourless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better sit down,” he said gently. “I can
manage alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she told him firmly. In spite of the soft
pallor of the neck and throat there was a look of
strength about her. He knew she would not faint.
The spirit of the girl shone in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But afterwards, when Dutch had been ordered
to lie down on the cot by the window, Hugh took
charge of Vicky without consulting her. He arranged
three chairs in such a way that they might
serve for a bed, padded them with sacks, and doubled
a blanket so that the girl could lie between its folds.
An old coat belonging to Ralph Dodson did well
enough for a pillow. In five minutes she was breathing
softly and regularly, though she had told Hugh
it would be impossible for her to sleep. The firelight
playing on her cheek reflected a faint and delicate
colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Vicky woke it was morning. A pale and
wintry sunbeam stole through the window. The
storm had passed. Hugh was cooking at the fireplace,
his back to her. The desperado was sleeping
noisily and restlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose, flushed with embarrassment, and arranged
her wrinkled and disordered skirts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good mo’ning,” the young man called cheerfully
without turning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning,” she answered shyly. For the
first time since she had come into the house a queer
surge of timidity swept her blood. The modesty
of the girl was in arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your shoes are on the hearth warming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He carried hot water in a basin to a summer
kitchen adjoining the main cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Towel hangin’ on the nail,” he told her when he
returned a moment later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky gave him a grateful look and passed into the
back room. Ten minutes later she emerged flushed
and radiant. The dark rebellious hair had been
smoothed down. To Hugh the blue dress looked
miraculously fresh and clean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come an’ get it,” he called, just as he would have
done to another man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His matter-of-fact acceptance of the situation
dissipated measurably her sense of alarm at the
shocked proprieties. If he were not disconcerted
at the intimacy into which the blizzard had plunged
them, why should she be? With the good healthy
appetite of youth she ate eggs, bacon, corn pone,
and two flapjacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When can we go?” she asked as he poured coffee
into the tin cup before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soon as we’ve eaten. Some job to buck the
drifts to town but we’ll make it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And him?” A little lift of her head showed that
Vicky’s elliptical question referred to Dutch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll notify his friends to come and look after him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh broke trail and Vicky followed in his steps.
They travelled slowly, for in places the drifts were
high. Usually the girl’s clear complexion showed
little colour, but now she glowed from exercise.
Once when he turned to lend her a hand through a
bank of snow she shook her head gaily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m doing fine. Isn’t it a <span class='it'>splendiferous</span> day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was. The sun had come out in all its glory and
was driving the clouds in ragged billows toward the
horizon. The snow sparkled. It was crisp and
sharp beneath their feet. The air, washed clean
by the tempest, filled the lungs as with wine. Not
on creation’s dawn had the world looked purer or
more unsullied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Youth calls to youth. Vicky looked at Hugh
with a new interest. She had always admired his
clean strength, the wholesome directness of his character.
To-day her eyes saw him differently. He
belonged to her generation, not that of Mollie and
Scot. For the first time his personality touched her
own life. They could not be the same hereafter.
They would have to know each other better—or not
at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her childhood days, when fairy tales were still
possible, she had dreamed of a prince in shining silver
armour, handsome as Apollo Belvedere, valiant as
Lancelot, a pure and ardent young Galahad. Now,
as she followed the trail breaker through the white
banks, an involuntary smile touched her lips. She
was wondering, in the shy daring fashion of a girl’s
exploring mind, what Hugh McClintock was really
like behind the mask of his physical clothing. Certainly
nobody could be less like the shining knight of
her dreams than he. For Hugh walked the straight
plain road of life without any heroic gestures. Ralph
Dodson made a far more romantic figure than Hugh.
Even Scot, with his native touch of the grand manner,
had more glamour for her than the younger
brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good old Hugh, faithful and true. She could not
think of anybody she liked better.</p>

<h3>OLD DOG TRAY BARKS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>J</span>im Budd</span> had picked up a new song. Much
to the relief of his sore-tried wife, he occasionally
monotoned it in place of the Grimes catalogue
of virtues and clothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky could hear him in the kitchen singing it now.</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Oddly enough the words hummed themselves into
Vicky’s musings. She was standing before the
mirror putting the finishing touches to a very attractive
picture, a picture of lovely youth, warm,
vital, piquant. Miss Vicky was expecting a caller,
and though she hadn’t any desire to dazzle this
particular admirer—if he were an admirer, for she
hadn’t made sure of that yet—she did not choose
to be so ungrateful as to neglect any of the natural
advantages with which a kind Providence had
endowed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She murmured the fat man’s refrain:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Budd poked her head into the room. “Hugh
McClintock,” she announced. “In the parlour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here to see me?” asked Miss Lowell, just as
though she had not known he was coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I kinda gather that notion. Anyhow, he asked
for you. Were you dollin’ up for me an’ Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be right down, tell him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would, dearie. He’s ce’tainly wearin’ out the
rim of his hat makin’ it travel in circles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After which shot Mrs. Budd puffed downstairs and
read the riot act mildly to Jim for having tracked
mud into her immaculate kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Hugh was embarrassed it was because of the
nature of his mission this evening. He had plenty
of native dignity, but he knew nothing of the thought
processes of young women going-on-eighteen. Would
they take well-meant advice in the same spirit in
which it was given? He did not know, but he
intended to find out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indirectly Vicky gave him a lead. “I’ve just had a
letter from Mollie. What do you think? Scot’s
going to run for secretary of state.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Made up his mind to run, has he? Knew he was
thinkin’ about it. Wonder if anybody else is goin’
after the Republican nomination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the girl quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh looked a surprised question at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Ralph Dodson is going to run,” she continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He let that sink in for a moment. “Sorry,” he
said. “It’s liable to open up the old sore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think it will?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless the Dodsons make it a personal
fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think Ralph would do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know him pretty well?” He put his comment
with the rising inflection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. That is, he comes to see me.” Vicky’s
chin was up ever so little. She sensed McClintock’s
hostility. “I like him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you? Can’t say I do. I don’t trust him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do <span class='it'>you</span> know him well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, and I don’t want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl laughed. “You remind me of what
Charles Lamb says in one of his essays. We were
reading it in school. Or maybe it was an anecdote
about him the teacher told us. Anyhow, he said he
didn’t like a certain man. A friend asked him if he
knew him. ‘Of course I don’t,’ Lamb said. ‘If
I did I’d like him. That’s why I don’t want to
know him.’ Is it like that with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He considered this gravely. “Maybe so. I’m
prejudiced against him on account of his brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s no fair,” the girl cried quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And because of two or three things I’ve known
him do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What things?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh did not care to discuss with Vicky the man’s
amours. He shifted ground. “He’s selfish through
and through. Thinks only of himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s eyes sparkled. “When you say that it
just shows how little you know him. He’s the most
generous man I ever met.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s good lookin’, and he’s hail fellow enough.
That’s not what I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it’s not what I mean,” she retorted, her
temper beginning to rise. “Two or three months
ago he did the bravest thing I ever saw—risked
his life for hours in a caved tunnel, to save the life
of a ragged little boy. Was that selfish? Was that
thinking only of himself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s game. He’ll go through,” admitted Hugh.
“I didn’t mean that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her stormy eyes challenged him. “Then just what
<span class='it'>do</span> you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh flushed. He did not find it possible to
tell her explicitly just what he did mean. It was
bad enough for him to be violating the masculine
instinct against exposing another man to one of the
opposite sex. He could not draw a bill of particulars
about Dodson before an innocent girl. Moreover,
what he had heard of the man’s escapades was
merely town gossip—true enough, he felt sure, but
not evidence that could be held good before an
ardent young advocate like Vicky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not very scrupulous some ways,” he said
lamely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What ways?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock felt himself being driven into a blind
alley. He could not go on, nor could he turn back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t want a sister of mine to know him
too well,” was the best he could do by way of explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s merely an expression of a personal feeling,”
she flashed. “And since I’m not your sister it
does not weigh with me. You come here and attack
my friend. You say he’s selfish and—unscrupulous.
I ask for facts to back what you’ve said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though he had been put helplessly in the wrong,
Hugh felt that he was right at bottom. Vicky
had no business to have this fellow on the list of
her friends. He tried to break from the logic of the
position into which she had forced him by an appeal
to their old friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I used to have a little partner named Vicky
Lowell. We did not see much of each other, but
we were tillicums. Oughtn’t I to warn her when
I see her going with the wrong kind of man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And oughtn’t I to ask you to <span class='it'>prove</span> to me he’s the
wrong kind? Or must I take it for granted and give up
any of my friends if you happen not to fancy them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you he isn’t right—not right for a girl
like you to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You admit yourself you’re prejudiced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not about that. If you’ll let me, I’ll call his
hand for a showdown. Let him prove to me he’s
been slandered and I’ll——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky exploded. “If you dare, Hugh McClintock!
Did Scot appoint you deputy guardian of me? Do
you think I can’t look after myself? Do you think
you can come here and slander my friends——?”
She broke off, white with anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave up, with a helpless lift of his hands.
“I made a mistake. Sorry. I believe every word
I’ve said, but I reckon I blundered somehow. I
meant the best ever, Vicky, but—oh, well, you can’t
see it my way. I’ll say good-evenin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh rose. He offered his strong brown hand and
with it a smile that asked for forgiveness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hesitated. Her anger at him was not yet spent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the next room came Jim Budd’s wheezy
refrain, tuneless and monotonous:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Old dog Tray ever faithful,</p>
<p class='line0'>Grief cannot drive him away.</p>
<p class='line0'>He’s gentle and he’s kind,</p>
<p class='line0'>And you’ll never, never find</p>
<p class='line0'>A better friend than old—dog—Tray.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Just old dog Tray,” Hugh said, and his smile was
a little wistful. “A faithful old blunderer, but
after all an honest friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky relented on swift impulse and gave him her
hand. “All right—old dog Tray. But I warn you
that you’ll have grief enough to drive you away if
you behave like this again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll come back even though you throw stones
at me,” he said, and this time his grin was gay.
“Maybe I’ll bark again at yore friends and maybe I
won’t. We’ll see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take my advice and don’t,” she warned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t take mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s only half of it. I’m not going to,”
the girl flung back, looking at him with a flash of
mischief in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can’t help that. It’s good medicine.”
He added a suggestion: “Tell Dodson that I warned
you against him if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why would I do that?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to feel underhanded about it. I’d
rather you did tell him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I won’t,” she said with decision. “What
kind of a girl do you think I am?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you want me to tell you how nice a girl I think
you are——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now—now,” she protested, laughing. “That’s
not what old dog Trays are for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought you asked me,” he replied with deep
innocence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First you were Mr. Goodman to me. Then you
were Santa Claus. Then Mr. Hugh McClintock.
Now you’re old dog Tray. I wonder what you’ll
be next,” she queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a flash their eyes met before the mask fell.
She drew back, startled; then decided that she
had been mistaken. For in that beat of time it
seemed to her that his soul had answered her question
and told her what he meant to be to her next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, she had imagined it.</p>

<h3>THE KILLER STRIKES</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>t</span> was generally recognized that the Republicans
would carry the state that year. The war
was still so near that it would have a determining
influence on thousands of voters. The chief local
interest centred in the race for the nomination of
the dominant party for secretary of state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was due to several factors. Chief of these
was the fight between two candidates of outstanding
personality, a fight which rapidly developed into a
bitter one. Scot McClintock was still the most
picturesque figure in Nevada, though he had left
behind him his wild escapades and his gay irresponsibility.
The mining camps were yet full of the
rumour of his adventures. In any assembly his
good looks, charm, and qualities of leadership made
him a marked figure. His audacity and courage
fitted the time and the place. Men tremendously
admired him because they saw in him what they
would like to be themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The character of Ralph Dodson made no appeal
to men’s affections. He was too cold and calculating,
his ambition too ruthless. But they recognized
his strength. He would travel a long way in
the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big mining interests supported Dodson.
Scot was too much a tribune of the people to suit
them. At any time he might embarrass the mine
owners by some quixotic gesture inspired by his
sense of justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot went out into the camps and the agricultural
valleys to make a personal campaign. If he had
been dealing with the voters individually he could
have made a runaway race of it. But delegates to
conventions, then as now, were under the influence
of leaders, who in turn took orders from the men
who financed the campaign. He was under a tremendous
handicap because he had only an individual
following to oppose a party machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet he made headway, and so fast that his opponent
became alarmed. Dodson came out in the
<span class='it'>Enterprise</span> with a savage attack on his rival in which
he accused him of being an ex-gambler and a bawdy-house
brawler. Scot kept his temper and made no
counter charges. From the stump he replied that
at least he had always been a square gambler. His
fighting record, he said carelessly, must take care of
itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky met Ralph Dodson on the Avenue at Piodie
while the campaign was at its height. She fired
point blank a charge at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I read what you said in the <span class='it'>Enterprise</span> about
Scot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed a little, but his eyes watched her
warily. “You’d think once in a while some newspaper
reporter would get a story right,” he said
easily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Wasn’t it true that you said it?” Her
level gaze met his steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was annoyed, and I said something. Don’t
remember just what. Certainly I didn’t intend to
insult any of your family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll deny it in the paper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it quite worth-while? Everybody knows what
newspapers are—how they’re keen to make everything
one says sensational.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you don’t deny it people will think you said it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We-ell, in a political campaign men get excited.
It doesn’t greatly matter what folks say—just part
of the game, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it part of the game to tell lies about a good
man?” she asked flatly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw up his hands gaily. “I surrender at
discretion. Will a note to the <span class='it'>Enterprise</span> correcting
the error suit your Majesty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not doing it for me,” she told him, her
dark eyes shining. “You’re doing it because it’s the
fair thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang the fair thing,” he answered, laughing.
“I’m doing it for Miss Victoria Lowell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d rather you didn’t.” She dimpled to a smile.
“Because I’m against you and for Scot in this fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll give up the race,” he mocked. “I
think you ought at least to be neutral.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dodson played his hand under cover after that.
He saw that McClintock was kept under a steady
fire of newspaper attack and that none of it could be
traced to him. No paper dared make any reference
to the origin of the trouble between Colonel McClintock
and the Dodsons, but hired assassins of reputation
whispered evil stories in which the names
of Mollie and Scot appeared. These became so
numerous that at last Scot in a speech full of eloquence
and fierce indignation referred to the traducers
of his wife as snakes in the grass who dared
not come into the open for fear of having the life
trampled out of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bitterness grew, became acute. Robert Dodson,
still full of venom and hatred, whispered in the ears
of killers. The word was passed around quietly that
McClintock might be shot down any time. Friends
came to warn him. They carried the word to Hugh,
who dropped his business at once and joined Scot
at Austin. From this time the younger man, in
spite of the Colonel’s good-humoured protest, travelled
over the state with his brother as a lookout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Carson the killers struck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot had addressed an enthusiastic meeting, at
which he had been heckled by supporters of Dodson
and had turned upon them with such witty scorn
that they had slipped out of the hall discomfited.
With Hugh beside him the speaker had returned to
the Ormsby House. The younger brother was
putting up at the house of a friend. He left Scot in
his room ready to undress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the colonel felt in his waistcoat pocket
for a cigar he found none. He stepped down to the
barroom to get one. Baldy Green, the old stage
driver, was sitting by the office stove. The two
fell into talk and Scot sat down to smoke his cigar
with the old-timer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man whom Scot did not know lounged into the
office and out again. In the darkness outside he
whispered to two men. One of them was the ex-mule-skinner
Hopkins, a dyed-in-the-wool bad man;
the other was Sam Dutch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hotel office had three doors. One opened
from the street, a rear one led to the rooms, the third
was a double swing door separating the office from
the bar. Scot’s chair was so placed that he faced
the entrance from the street and the bar. His back
was half-turned to the rear one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stage driver was talking. “You betcha,
Colonel. If us old-timers had the say-so we’d elect
you by a mile. Sure would. That slick scalawag
Dodson, why he—he——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot’s first warning came from Baldy’s consternation.
His eyes popped out. They were staring
at some apparition in the back of the room. The
words of his sentence stuck in the roof of his mouth.
Almost simultaneously came the click McClintock
knew from of old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He whirled in the chair dragging at his revolver.
It caught on his coat. Two bolts of lightning flamed.
The crash of heavy thunder filled the room. Scot
sagged in his seat, the curly head falling forward
heavily on the chest. From his slack fingers the
revolver dropped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the guns boomed. Another jagged knife
thrust of pain went through and through Scot’s
body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got him. Got him good, Sam,” an exultant
voice announced hoarsely through the smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hulking figure slouched forward cautiously.
The victim lay huddled in the chair motionless, both
hands empty of weapons. No sign of life showed in
the lax body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always said I’d git him.” Dutch broke into
a storm of oaths. He reversed his revolver and
struck the fallen head savagely with the butt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d better make a getaway,” the other man
said hurriedly. “This ain’t no healthy place for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gorilla-man struck again and broke the hammer
of his revolver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out this way,” he said, and pushed through the
swinging doors to the bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heavy blows had beaten McClintock down so
that he slid from the chair. The doctor who attended
him afterwards said that the effect of them
was temporarily to act as a counter-shock to the
bullet wounds. His senses cleared and his hand
found the revolver. He was cocking it as the second
assassin vanished through the swing doors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot concentrated his strength and energy, focussing
every ounce of power left in him to do the thing
in his mind. With his left hand as a support he
raised the six-shooter and fired through the swing
door. Then, inch by inch, he crawled forward
to the barroom entrance, shoved the door open with
his shoulder, and tried again to lift the forty-five.
It was not in his ebbing forces to raise the heavy
weapon from the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was no need to use it again. The mule-skinner
Hopkins lay face down on the floor, arms
flung wide. Scot’s shot through the swing door had
killed him instantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baldy knelt beside his friend. “Did they get you,
old-timer?” he asked, his voice shaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m still kicking. Send for Hugh,” the wounded
man gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later Hugh stood beside the bedside
of his brother. Scot’s face was bloodless to the lips.
He was suffering a good deal and was very weak.
The doctor had told Hugh that he would not live
till morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going—to—make it,” Scot said faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wire—for—Mollie. Tell her—not to—worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie came down from Virginia. She reached
Carson by daybreak. Scot was still living, still
holding his own, though the doctors held out no
hope of recovery. At the end of forty-eight hours
he was in a high fever, but his strength was unabated.
The fever broke. He came out of it weak but with
the faint, indomitable smile of the unconquered on his
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hand pressed Mollie’s softly. “It’s all right,
sweetheart. I’ll make it sure,” he promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tears welled into her eyes. His courage took
her by the throat and choked her, for the doctors
still gave her no encouragement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she whispered, and tried to keep the sob
out of her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s a li’l’ thing like three bullets among one
perfectly good man?” he asked whimsically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not to talk, the doctor says,” she reproved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Where’s Hugh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He left yesterday to ’tend to some business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What business?” A frown of anxiety wrinkled
his pale forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did he go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t ask him. He said he’d be back to-day
or to-morrow, one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot thought this over, still with a troubled face.
He guessed what this important business was that
had called Hugh from his bedside at such a critical
time. But he did not hint to Mollie his suspicion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When he comes back will you let me know right
away, Honey? Or if he wires?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Now you must stop talking and take this
powder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smile that was a messenger to carry her all his
love rested in his eyes. “I’ll be good, Mollie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the medicine and presently fell asleep.</p>

<h3>HUGH HITS THE TRAIL</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>hile Hugh</span> was still at the bedside of his
brother he began to make arrangements
for the thing he meant to do. Already
he knew that Sam Dutch had left town. Word
had come to him that two horsemen in a desperate
hurry had clattered down the street from Doc
Benton’s stable. They had disappeared in the
darkness. But the man who had seen them go had
not recognized the companion of Dutch. Nor could
he tell whether the riders had turned off Carson
Street into King’s Cañon road, had swung to the
right along the foothills road, or had held to a straight
course toward Reno.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news of the outrage spread fast. Friends of
the McClintocks poured into the Ormsby House by
scores to see if there was anything they could do.
Among them were the Governor, a Justice of the
Supreme Court, half-a-dozen state senators and representatives,
and the sheriff of the county.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was characteristic of Hugh that even in the
anguish he felt at seeing his brother stricken from
lusty health by the bullets of assassins his mind
worked with orderly precision. When he thought
of the murderers a cold, deadly anger possessed him,
but if possible he meant his vengeance to come
within the law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s one thing you can do, Phil,” he said to the
sheriff. “Swear me in as a special deputy. I’m
goin’ out to get Dutch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To bring him back here, you mean?” asked the
officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock’s eyes were inscrutable. “Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, looky here, son, that’s our job,” the sheriff
remonstrated. “I’m gonna git that fellow. He’s
run on the rope too long. You stay right here with
Scot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I want Dutch. He’s mine. Hands off till
I can leave Scot, Phil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff argued, but he could not move the
grim-faced man from his purpose. At last he gave
way with a shrug of his shoulders. A wilful man
must have his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, son, I’ll swear you in if you’ll promise to
bring Dutch back to Carson providin’ you git him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promise that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alive,” the sheriff added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alive,” agreed Hugh, meeting him eye to eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baldy Green showed his teeth in a mirthless grin.
“A few of us here in town’ll guarantee that if you
bring him alive he won’t go away alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officer turned on him angrily. “That’s a fine
way to talk, Baldy. You hold yore lines tighter.
Monkey with my prisoner an’ I’ll show you a scatter
gun that throws buckshot all over Carson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Hugh kept the wires hot with messages.
He telegraphed friends at Virginia, Reno, Piodie, and
Genoa, asking for news of the fugitives. His suspicion
fastened on Robert Dodson as the man who
was riding with Dutch. He knew the man had been
in town earlier in the day, and he could not through
his friends locate him here now. The night travellers
might make for Virginia, where Dutch could lie
hidden in one of the Dodson mines till the excitement
was past. Or they might be making for Genoa with
the intention of crossing the Sierras to California.
More likely still they were headed for Piodie, where
the sheriff, the law machinery, and the town bad
men were all friendly to the Dodson interests. So
Hugh reasoned it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff shook his head. “Don’t look to me
like Dodson would mix himself up with Dutch now.
Maybe he hired him to do this killing. I don’t
say he did. I don’t know. But it ain’t reasonable
that he’d give himself away by ridin’ hellamile outa
town with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ralph Dodson wouldn’t, but you can’t tell what
his brother might do. My notion is he didn’t intend
to go, but afterwards lost his nerve and wouldn’t
stick it out here alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’d be like Bob Dodson,” Baldy confirmed.
“He’s got a sure enough rabbit heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>None of the answers to his telegrams brought
Hugh the message he hoped for. The fugitives had
not been seen at Virginia, Genoa, or Reno, though it
was quite possible they might have reached or passed
through any of these places unnoticed. He decided
to play what would nowadays be called a hunch.
The natural place for them to go was Piodie, and
it was there he meant to look for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctors gave him no hope for Scot, but they
now believed that his remarkable vitality would keep
him alive several days. Hugh arranged to keep
in touch with Baldy Green by wire. Now that the
railroad was in operation he could get back to town
within a few hours if an emergency call came for
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rode down to Reno and there boarded the
Overland. A couple of hours later he left it at a small
way station and engaged a saddle horse. He guessed
that if the fugitives had gone to Piodie they would
leave watchers to report on any strangers who might
come to town. Therefore, four miles out of Piodie
he left the road, took a cow trail that swung round
Bald Knob, and dropped down a little gulch that led
to the back of the Pony Express Corral, and under
cover of dusk slipped into the stable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byers was there alone. “How’s Scot?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad,” said Hugh, and his haggard face twitched.
“Doctor don’t think he’ll make it. What about
Dutch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got in last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dodson with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small man nodded. He was always parsimonious
of words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know where he is now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the Katie Brackett. Rode right out there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh knew that this meant his enemies were
playing it safe. The Katie Brackett was owned and
controlled by the Dodsons. Here they were on home
territory, surrounded by adherents. If a sheriff’s
posse appeared on the road leading to the mine
Dutch would be safely underground in one of the
levels long before it reached the shaft house. There
he would be as secure as a needle in a haystack.
Even if the sheriff elected to search the mine, the
bad man could play hide and seek with the posse
in a hundred stopes, drifts, and crosscuts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ralph Dodson in town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Virginia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was one piece of good news. With the
younger mine owner absent he would have one less
enemy to contend with, and the most dangerous
of the three. For Ralph was game, audacious,
and brainy. It would hardly have been possible
to get the killer out of Piodie with young Dodson
running the campaign for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m goin’ up after him,” Hugh said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With that gang round him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe I’ll catch him alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And maybe not.” Byers stepped to the wall
and took down from a peg a belt to which was attached
a revolver. He strapped on the belt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Dan,” Hugh told him. “I’m playin’ a lone
hand. My only chance is to lie low and surprise
Dutch before he knows I’m within a hundred miles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hmp! What if he surprises you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be Number Sixteen. But he won’t. I’m
goin’ to take him back to Carson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sound of feet moving at a shuffling run.
A man burst through the doorway and stopped at
sight of them. The runner was Jim Budd. For
a few moments he stood panting, unable to find his
breath for speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up, Jim?” asked Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fat man wheezed out an answer. “H-hell to
pay! The Katie Brackett’s afire, an’ the day shift’s
down in her, caught in a drift.”</p>

<h3>TRAPPED</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>s</span> the three friends hurried up Pine Nut Gulch
toward the Katie Brackett the youngest of
them reflected that the method of approach
had been made smooth for him. It was not now
necessary for him to skulk up through the sage. The
whole town was on its way to the scene of the disaster.
A stream of people was headed for the mine.
Nimble boys passed them on the run. Less active
citizens they overtook and left behind. The sounds
of voices, of movements of many people, came to
them through the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh still carried his sawed-off shotgun. He
might need it. He might not. He realized that for
the moment his vengeance must take second place.
The common thought and effort of Piodie must
centre on the business of saving the poor fellows
trapped in that fiery furnace six hundred feet below
ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The superintendent of the mine was calling for
volunteer rescuers just as Hugh and Dan reached
the shaft house. McClintock hid his shotgun under
a pile of lumber and stepped forward. The cage
was a double decker. There was a rush of men to
get on the lower floor. They knew well enough the
danger that faced them, but it is a risk a brave miner
is always willing to take for the lives of doomed
companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on! Get back there. Don’t crowd!”
ordered the superintendent. “No married man
can go. You, Finlay—and Trelawney—and Big
Bill. That makes six. All right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lower compartment dropped and the second
level was even with the ground. The superintendent
stepped into the cage. Byers crowded in next.
Budd, puffing hard, pushed close. With an elbow
driven hard into his midriff Hugh thrust him back.
“Don’t you hear? No married men wanted, Jim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock vaulted over the edge of the cage and
dropped into it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A big Ayrshire mucker shouted at the superintendent.
“An’ when did ye divorce your wife an’
twa weans, boss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to go, Sandy. It’s my job,” the mine
boss called back. “That’s all. No room for more.
Jam that gate shut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The engineer moved a lever and the bucket
dropped into the darkness. Every few seconds
there was a flash of light as the cage passed a station.
Except for that the darkness was dense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh heard someone beside him say, “I hear
Dodson’s caught in a drift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carstairs, the superintendent, answered: “Yes.
Dutch is with him. They went to look at that new
vein we struck yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No accident contains more terrible possibilities
than a fire in a mine. Flame and gas pursue the
trapped victims as they fly. Cut off from the shaft,
buried hundreds of feet in the ground, the miners run
the risk of being asphyxiated, burned, or blown
up in an explosion of released gases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shaft, the drifts, the crosscuts, and the tunnels
all act as flues to suck the flames into them. At
Piodie, as at Virginia City, the danger was intensified
by the great quantity of fuel with which these
natural chimneys were lined. In the Katie Brackett
whole forests were buried. Every drift and tunnel
was braced with timbers. Scores of chutes, with
vertical winzes, all made of wood, led from one level
to another. The ore chambers were honeycombed
with square sets of timber mortised together and
wedged against the rock walls and roof. Upon each
set floors of heavy planking were laid. In these were
trap doors, through which steps ran leading from
the lower level to the one above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire was in the north drift. Carstairs led the
men forward cautiously. Already their eyes were
inflamed from the smoke that rolled out at them.
As they moved forward heat waves struck them.
The rock walls were so hot that the rescuers could
with difficulty keep going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh was at the nozzle of the hose they were
dragging. He kept a stream playing on the rock
and the charred timber. Presently he fell back,
overcome by the intense heat, and Carstairs took
his place. Byers succeeded the superintendent at
the apex of the attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steam, sulphur, fumes, and gas released from the
minerals swept the rescuers back. The air was so
foul that the workers could not breathe it without
collapsing. An air pipe was led in from the main
blower above, and the volunteers renewed their
efforts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At times the swirling smoke was too much for
them. It either drove them to the shaft or it forced
them to lie with their faces close to the ground
where the air was purer. Farther down the tunnel
they could see red tongues of flame licking at them.
The roar of the fire as it leaped forward was far more
appalling than that of any wild beast could have
been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The faces of the firemen were smoke-blackened and
grimy. Already several had collapsed from the
intense heat. These were helped back to the shaft
and sent up. Others came down to take their places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh’s eyebrows crisped from the heat. The men
were all naked from the waist up. Below this they
wore only cotton overalls and boots. These were
licked to a char thin and fragile as paper. The skin
peeled from Hugh’s body in flakes where anything
touched it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From above came an ominous sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back,” ordered Carstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The roof came down, an avalanche of dirt and rock
and timber. So close was McClintock to it that the
air shock almost knocked him down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the dust had settled Carstairs sent his
sappers at the job of clearing out and timbering the
tunnel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steadily the rescuers gained ground. Every few
minutes they relayed each other. Each man knew
that his position was one of great danger. The fire
might reach the shaft and cut them off from above.
A cave of rock might release gases which might kill
either by explosion or asphyxiation. A change of
draught might fling a great tongue of fire at them
and wipe the whole party out in a few seconds. Yet
the work went on, hour after hour, steadily and
without ceasing. For somewhere in one of the
crosscuts which they were approaching, a group of
haggard, anxious men were awaiting rescue, unless
the fire had already snuffed out their lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The crosscut’s just ahead,” Carstairs announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byers was at the nozzle. The little man had stuck
it out gamely. Only four of the original party were
still working. The others had been relieved and
sent to the surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock had just returned from the shaft
where he had been with a man overcome by the heat.
He was for the moment the freshest man in the group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two volunteers to search the crosscut while
the rest hold back the fire,” called Carstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go,” said a Maine lumberjack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Same here,” added Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They waited, watching for a chance to plunge into
the side tunnel when the fire was momentarily low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said McClintock, and he dived at the
opening in the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lumberjack followed him. So intense was
the heat at the entrance to the crosscut that a little
pool of water on the rock floor was boiling angrily.
As they pushed deeper into it the heat decreased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh shouted. A voice answered his call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved forward and presently stumbled over
a body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many in here?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eleven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are the others?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead,” came the answer. “Cut off by fire damp
before we reached the crosscut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All of you able to travel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh heard the sound of footsteps stumbling
toward him. Men came abreast of him and went
past. He counted them—eleven. Then he stooped
and picked up the body at his feet. In another
minute he was staggering into the drift with his
burden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire fighters fell back past the charred timbers
and the hot rocks of the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re through, boys,” Carstairs said. “I’ll
send a fresh crew in to blast down the mouth of the
drift and build a bulkhead against the fire. Then
we’ll close the shaft and let ’er die down for lack of
air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first thing Hugh did when he reached the foot
of the shaft was to find the revolver he had hidden
beneath a car; the next was to look over the rescued
men for the one he wanted. He found him, standing
beside Robert Dodson close to the cage. The mine
owner was sobbing with the strain he had undergone.
His nerve had gone. The big hulking figure at his
back was Sam Dutch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh kept in the background. He did not want
to be recognized just yet. Meanwhile, he slipped
into his trousers, shirt, and coat. In the pocket
of his coat was something that jingled when he
accidentally touched the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rescued men were in much better condition
than the ones who had fought the fire to save them.
They had reached the precarious safety of the crosscut
in time to avail themselves of its comparatively
fresh air. The volunteers were worn out, fagged, and
burned to a toast. Some of them had inhaled gases
and smoke that would enfeeble their lungs for
months. They moved like automatons, their energy
gone, their strength exhausted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cage came down and the men began to pile in.
Hugh was standing close behind a huge man whom
his eyes never left. He pushed into the lower
level of the cage after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The car shot upward. Hugh drew something
from his pocket. In the darkness his hand moved
gently to and fro. It found what it was seeking.
There was a click, a second click, a furious, raucous
oath of rage like the bellow of a maddened bull
elephant. Hugh had slipped handcuffs on the
thick wrists of Dutch and locked them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His thumb jammed hard into the spine of the
desperado. “Steady in the boat,” he murmured.
“This gun’s liable to spill sudden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The car rose into the fresh daylight of the young
morning.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch28'>CHAPTER XXVIII</h1></div>

<h3>“AS GOOD AS THE WHEAT”</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>hrough</span> the crowd at the mouth of the
mine word flashed that the cage was coming
up. All night they had waited there, the wives
and children of the imprisoned miners, the residents
of Piodie who knew one or another of the men caught
in the raging inferno below. The women and the
little ones had wept themselves dry of tears long
since. They stood now with taut nerves, eyes
glued to the cage as it swept into sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Someone started a cheer as the first of the rescued
men stepped out to the platform. A wail of anguish
rose above it and killed the cheer. It came from a
young wife with a shawl over her head. She had
asked a question of one of the men and learned
that her husband was dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd pressed close to those who had come
up from the fire. A woman gave a sob of joy and
fell into the arms of a grimy Cousin Jack. Another
caught a glimpse of her husband’s face and fainted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the excitement two men pushed through the
crowd toward a pile of lumber. The one in front
moved with sullen reluctance. Only the pressure
against his back kept him going. Nobody noticed
that he was handcuffed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From underneath the lumber pile the second man
drew a sawed-off shotgun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll be movin’ down to town,” he told his captive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch shouted one word, “Dodson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mine owner swung round, and at the first
glance understood the situation. He turned pale
and stepped behind Carstairs. Not for a moment
did he doubt that McClintock had come to kill
Dutch. Would he make a clean sweep of it and
shoot him, too? Convicted of guilt, he crouched
behind his superintendent shaking like an aspen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let him kill me,” he begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh spoke, his voice cold and hard. “I’m not
on the shoot to-day, Dodson—unless you force my
hand, you black-hearted murderer. I’m here to
take Dutch back to Carson with me. The yellow
wolf shot my brother in the back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No such thing. I got him in a fair fight,”
blustered Dutch. “An’ I ain’t goin’ to Carson with
you, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re going, <span class='it'>dead or alive</span>.” McClintock’s face
and voice were as inexorable as the day of judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s aimin’ to take me there to be killed,”
Dutch cried out. “You boys won’t stand for that.”
He named two or three of the men with whom he
consorted, picking them out of the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure we won’t.” A gunman stepped forward
briskly. “You can’t pull that over here, McClintock.
You don’t own this camp, an’ you can’t play chief
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two men lined up with Hugh, one on each side
of him. The man on his right was a whale of a fat
man. Deftly he slid McClintock’s revolver from
its holster. The second ally was a small wiry fellow.
From a grimy blackened face keen eyes peered
intently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fat man spoke. “Don’t run on the rope,
Sloan. We’re with the kid on this. He’s a deputy
sheriff, an’ it’ll sure be ‘Let’s gather at the river’
for some of you anxious gents if you overplay yore
hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sloan hesitated. He could not very well look
round to see whether the gang of which he was one
were present in numbers, and, if so, whether they
would support him. He knew these three men of
old. They belonged to the pony express outfit,
as hard-riding and fast shooting a group of men
as the West has known. It was certain that Dutch
could not be rescued without a fight, and Sloan
was hardly in a position to call for a showdown. He
was game enough. With McClintock alone he would
have taken a chance. But the three of them were
too many for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff of the county saved his face. He
bustled forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tut, tut! What’s all this?” he asked fussily.
“There’s good law in this town, lots of it. No need
of gun plays. If Mr. Dutch is wanted, there’s a
right an’ proper way to get him, but that way ain’t
at the point of a gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“McClintock’s a deputy sheriff,” put in Budd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was rivalry between him and the sheriff.
Budd was a candidate for the party nomination
at the coming primaries. The wise politicians
admitted that even with the Dodsons against him
the fat man had a chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d oughta know better’n that, Budd, an’ you
a candidate for sheriff,” the officer reproved. “Say
he is a deputy. He can’t go cavortin’ round all
over Nevada, California, and Utah arrestin’ any one
he’s a mind to. Where’s his warrant? Whyn’t
he come to me with it like a reasonable man would—that
is, if he’s got one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With his left hand Hugh felt in his pocket and
produced a warrant. He handed it to the sheriff.
That gentleman ran his eye over it. He returned it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good only in Ormsby County,” he snapped.
“What arrestin’ is done here I do—leastways, at
present,” he added with a sarcastic grin at Budd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fat man was caught. He knew nothing about
the technicalities of arrests. What the sheriff said
might or might not be true. He tried a bluff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This here’s an extra-territorial warrant that runs
ex judicio,” he explained largely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That so?” asked the sheriff ironically. “Well,
it sure don’t hold water here. Bad men can’t get
on the prod with me. No, siree!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cage had descended to bring up a second load
of miners. Meanwhile, the interest of the crowd
centred on the dispute that had arisen. Those on
the outskirts pressed forward, eager to hear what
was being said. Sloan had fallen back and was
whispering in the ears of a few choice spirits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh spoke out straight and strong. His words
were not for the sheriff, but for the judgment of the
unbiased public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came here as an officer with a warrant to get
this man. Three days ago he shot down from behind
the best man in Nevada, Scot McClintock. Most
of you know my brother, a first-class citizen and
soldier. He ran this scalawag out of Virginia, and
he made the mistake of not killin’ him right then.
I’ve made that same mistake myself three times.
Yet yore sheriff says I’m a bad man because I come
here to arrest a fifteen-times murderer. How about
that, boys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd was with Hugh at once. The Dodsons
controlled the camp. A good many of these men
were dependent upon them financially. But even
Ralph Dodson was hardly popular. As for Dutch,
their camp bully, everybody feared him and nobody
trusted him. He was so confirmed a gunman that
at any moment while in drink he might slay any
of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff had not volunteered to go down into
the mine with one of the rescue parties; nor had
Sloan or any of his cronies. But this young fellow
with the fire-blackened face and hands, whose haggard
eyes looked out with such quiet grim resolution,
had gone into that hell below to save their friends.
Byers, the man on his left, had been another of the
rescuers. The fat man had volunteered three times
and been rejected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His warrant goes in Piodie,” someone shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure does,” echoed another voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not on yore tintype,” retorted the sheriff.
“Ormsby County don’t run our affairs. Not none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Maine lumberjack lined up beside Hugh, an axe
shaft in his hand. He had observed that Dodson and
Sloan were gathering the camp toughs for a rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His warrant’s good with me—good as the wheat,”
the big woodsman said. “He made it good, boys,
when he stood up to that hose nozzle down below
and stuck there while he baked. He made it good
again when he went in to the crosscut where our
friends were trapped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sloan and his crowd moved forward. One of them
spoke to the sheriff. “If you want to swear in some
deputies to enforce the law, Dick, why, we’re right
here handy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From out of the crowd a girl darted, light as a deer.
She stood directly in front of Hugh, face to face
with the gunmen of the camp. A warm colour
breathed in her cheeks. Her dark eyes flashed with
indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you touch him. Don’t you dare touch
him,” she cried. “It was my brother this—this
villain killed. He did shoot him from behind. I’ve
had a letter. It was murder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A murmur of resentment passed like a wave
through the crowd. They knew the slim young
school teacher told the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t I know?” she went on ardently, beautiful
in her young unconsciousness of self as a flaming
flower. “Wasn’t I there when he tried to kill Hugh
here—and Hugh frozen from the blizzard so that
he couldn’t lift a hand to help himself? Oh, he’s—he’s
a terrible man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is that,” an Irishwoman’s voice lifted. “But
glory be, there’s wan man not afraid to comb his
whiskers for him. An’ it’s a brave colleen y’are to
spake up for your fine young man like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A roar of approval went up into the air. Men
surged forward, and women, too, to express their
gratitude by standing between this young man and
the Dodson faction. Vicky, rosy with embarrassment,
vanished in the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon you don’t get a chance to use yore
scatter gun this trip,” Budd said with a grin. “Prospects
look bilious for this killer you got rounded up.
Sure do. I never did see such a son-of-a-gun as you,
Kid. Me, I’d ’a’ bet an ounce of gold against a
dollar Mex you never would ’a’ walked into Piodie
an’ took Sam Dutch out. But that there miracle
is what you’re gonna pull off, looks like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Went right down into the Katie Brackett after
him,” chuckled Byers. “Brought him from that
hell hole with the cuffs on him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sho! It’s you boys that helped me out,” said
Hugh. “And I haven’t got him to Carson yet,
anyhow. Sloan won’t give up without makin’ a try
to get Dutch from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evidently the gunmen knew better than to challenge
public opinion at present. They drew off
to the mine boarding house and left Hugh free to
return to Piodie with his prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock thanked the lumberjack and others
who had come to his aid, and started down the gulch,
accompanied by a straggling guard of townspeople
returning to their homes for breakfast after a long
and anxious night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch shambled in front of him through the sage.
After a period of violent cursing he had fallen into
a savage and vindictive silence. He, too, believed
that his allies would not desert him without a fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath the superficial needs of the moment
Hugh’s thoughts were of Vicky. He had all the
average man’s healthy reluctance at being defended
by a woman, but deeper than this was his admiration
for the spirit of the girl. He had never seen anything
lovelier, more challenging, than the slender girl
glowing with passionate indignation on his behalf.
She had looked like a picture he had seen of Joan of
Arc standing before the French army, her sword
outflung and her young body clad in shining armour.</p>

<h3>VICKY FINDS A WAY</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>V</span>icky,</span> in her bedroom at Mrs. Budd’s, flogged
herself with a whip of scorn. She had acted
on imperative impulse, just as she used to do
when she was a little girl. Her cheeks flamed again
when she recalled what the Irishwoman had said.
Of course! Everybody would think she had done it
because she was in love with Hugh McClintock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Savagely she mocked her own heroics. She had
behaved ridiculously. There was no excuse for her
at all. Probably Hugh, too, was laughing at her or
else flattering himself that he had made a conquest.
Her pride rebelled. And yet—when she saw again
in imagination the group of gunmen under Sloan
moving forward to attack, she knew that she would
probably do the same thing a second time, given
the same circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Budd knocked on the door. “Breakfast
ready, deary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Lowell became aware suddenly that she was
very hungry. But she did not want to meet Jim
Budd. He would probably start teasing her, and if
he did she would certainly lose her temper. She
fibbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not hungry yet. If you don’t mind I’ll come
down and get a bite out of the pantry later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. McClintock is here. He wants to thank
you,” the landlady said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh McClintock was the last man in the world
that Vicky wanted to see just now, but she would
not for a month’s salary have let him know it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He needn’t trouble, I’m sure,” she said carelessly.
“But I’ll be down presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came to breakfast stormy-eyed. Hugh rose
to meet her from his seat next the door. He offered
his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a fraction of a second she looked at it, apparently
surprised. It was as though she said, a
little disdainfully, “What’s the use of all this fuss
about nothing?” Then her hand met his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said, in a low voice, “Old dog Tray’s mighty
grateful, Vicky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he spoke with a smile, words unstressed. She
drew a breath of relief. Hugh understood, anyhow.
He was not imagining any foolishness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I didn’t want them to take that villain from
you,” she explained. “I’ll not be satisfied till he’s
hanged. What have you heard about Scot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A telegram last night and one this mo’ning. He’s
still holdin’ his own, the doctors say. But they’re
not hopeful. One of the bullets went into his intestines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears brimmed her eyes. “Isn’t it dreadful—when
people are happy, like Scot and Mollie,
that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded, his throat tightening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let these buckwheats get cold,” Mrs. Budd
said cheerfully, bustling in with a hot plateful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Budd was sitting in the kitchen guarding the
prisoner, but Byers, Hugh, and Vicky, with an occasional
word from Mrs. Budd, discussed plans for
getting Dutch to Carson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both Hugh and Byers were exhausted. The night
through which they had just come had been a terrible
one. Their bodies from which the skin peeled
in flakes at several points of contact with their
clothes, were a torment to them. Eyebrows, eyelashes,
and some of the front hair had crisped away.
The faces of both of them were fire-red, and from
sunken sockets blear-eyed old age gazed listlessly.
They needed sleep certainly, medical attention
possibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s dark eyes softened as she looked at them.
They had fought a good fight, just as a matter of
course and all in the day’s work. She had been
down a mine. Her imagination filled in the horrors
of the fearful hours in that hell’s cauldron from
which they had at last dragged the imprisoned
miners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me send for Doctor Rogers,” she said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You feelin’ sick, Vicky?” Hugh asked with a
flare of humour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean, to look at you and Mr. Byers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We ain’t much to look at right now. I expect
he’d rather see us some time when we’re not so dog
tired. Find us more entertainin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’d better go upstairs and sleep. Mr.
Budd says he’ll watch your prisoner till night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what then?” asked Hugh. “We can’t just
saddle up and hit the trail for Carson. Never in
the world get there. By this time they’ve wired to
Ralph Dodson. He’s on the job at the other end
of the line.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes you think so?” Vicky asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because Bob Dodson hired Dutch to shoot Scot.
He showed it when he lit out with him in the middle
of the night. Dodson has got to stand by Dutch
to keep him from telling all he knows. He’s sure
sent a hurry-up call for help to brother Ralph.
Their play is to prevent me from reaching Carson
with Dutch a prisoner. Once there, with feeling
in the town high against him, the killer would be
liable to tell who was back of the shooting. He’d
do it out of revenge because he had not been rescued.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can telegraph to Carson for help and have
friends come and meet you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would mean a pitched battle. Can’t have
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, you go to bed and sleep,” Vicky said
imperatively. “We can decide later about how
you’re going to reach Carson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh nodded. “You’ll have me wakened if any
word comes about Scot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within a few minutes both men, and Dutch, too,
were sound asleep. It was late in the afternoon when
Mrs. Budd knocked on Hugh’s door to awaken him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found Vicky waiting for him in the sitting room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look better,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel a hundred years younger,” he answered.
“Any news about Scot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll leave to-night. Can’t stay away any longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. That would be best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the house watched?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t help it. I’ll go soon as I’ve eaten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going, too,” she told him. “I ought to be
with Mollie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You come to-morrow—not to-day. There may be
trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, there won’t be any trouble—and I’m going
with you,” she answered. There was a queer little
smile on her face, a smile of friendly mockery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going alone, you know,” he explained.
“Dutch travels with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there’ll be three of us.” She stepped to the
kitchen door, but before she opened it mirth bubbled
in her face and broke to laughter. “Come in, Mr.
Dutch. We start on a long journey about dusk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch shuffled into the room—at least the man was
Dutch in walk, in manner, dress, and beard. Hugh
looked at him again, and still a third time, before he
discovered that this was Jim Budd made up for the
part of the desperado.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man’s puzzled eyes asked a question of
Vicky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We three are going after supper,” she explained.
“Their lookout is over at Schmidt’s blacksmith shop.
Mr. Budd will seem to have his hands tied. Of
course he’ll think it’s your prisoner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Jim doesn’t begin to tell him all about old
Grimes,” McClintock said drily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you mustn’t sing, Mr. Budd. You know
there aren’t many voices like yours,” the girl replied,
laughing. “He’ll notify his friends, and they’ll
follow us. Probably they’ll telegraph ahead that
we’re coming. Very likely a welcome party will
come to meet us. By that time Mr. Budd will be Mr.
Budd, and somebody will be sold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good enough,” agreed Hugh. “But haven’t
you forgot one small detail? The real Dutch has
got to go to Carson. That’s what I came here for—to
get him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll go. As soon as the sheriff’s posse has clattered
past after us, Mr. Byers and your prisoner will
take a very quiet walk up the gulch and round Bald
Knob. Horses are waiting there somewhere; I don’t
know just where. Your friend the lumberjack with
the axe handle took them. He and Mr. Byers will
ride across the hills with the prisoner to Carson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh looked at the eager, vital girl with frank
admiration. “You’re a wonder, Vicky, one sure
enough whirlwind when you get going. Sounds
reasonable—if Dodson’s crowd let us get goin’ as you
figure they will. But you can’t tell. They may
stop us right when we start up the cañon. Then
they’ll know Jim here isn’t Dutch, and the fat will
certainly be in the fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Hugh, we’ve had a message from a friend in
the enemy’s camp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From Irish Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carberry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. At least, we think it’s from him. One of
my little boys brought me a note. Here it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh read the words scribbled on a sheet of torn
note paper.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Tell McClintock to look out for trouble near Bell’s Camp.
He’ll be caught between two fires if he tries to take Dutch with
him.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>A Friend.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes you think Carberry wrote this?”
asked Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned described the man who gave it to him,”
Budd explained. “He’s sure a ringer for Carberry—even
to that red shirt he wears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Might be Tom,” agreed Hugh. “My vote saved
his life from the vigilantes at Aurora. Tom’s not
such a bad sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see we’re safe till we reach Bell’s Camp,”
interpreted Vicky. “The sheriff and the gunmen
he appoints as deputies will follow behind us and
we’ll be driven into the arms of those who come to
meet us. That’s the plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—if Irish Tom wrote this and it’s not a trap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, beggars can’t be choosers,” she cried
impatiently. “I don’t suppose you have a better
way to suggest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only in one particular, Vicky. No need of you
going. There might be shooting. I don’t say there
will, but there might be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiddlesticks! There won’t be, not if I’m there.
Think I don’t know Ralph Dodson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Budd came unexpectedly to her aid. “Miss
Lowell’s sure right, Hugh. You <span class='it'>know</span> if she’s with
us there won’t be no gun-play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh hesitated. What his friends said was true
enough. The West, even at its worst, was very careful
of its good women. No weapons would be used
in the presence of Victoria Lowell. But there was in
him an extreme reluctance to use her skirts as a
protection behind which to hide. He wanted to
play his own hand and take Dutch out openly in
the face of opposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet he knew this was not possible. Vicky had
worked out a feasible plan of operations. It was only
fair to give it a tryout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” he conceded rather ungraciously.
“Have it yore own way, good people. Vicky,
you’re road boss of this outfit. Go to it. When
do we start, did you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky dimpled with delight. “Right after supper.”</p>

<h3>AT BELL’S CAMP</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span> boy</span> rode up the street leading two saddled
horses. He stopped in front of the Budd
house, from which three persons emerged in
answer to his shrill whistle. The lookout in the
shadow of Schmidt’s blacksmith shop leaned forward
to peer into the failing light. First came a huge,
shambling man, hairy and bearded, his hands tied
together in front of him. At his heels walked a
straight lithe figure recognized instantly by the
watcher as McClintock. The deputy carried a
revolver. A young woman in riding dress brought
up the rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock handed his revolver to the lady after
he had helped her mount. He adjusted the stirrups
of all the saddles. To the watcher up the street
it seemed that all his movements were hurried and
furtive. Plainly the travellers wanted to be gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had they started into the cañon than
the lookout was off to make his report. Inside of
five minutes a party of four horsemen swung round
the bend of the road into the gorge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half a mile up the cañon Hugh stopped to free
Budd’s hands. This done, he waited a moment
to listen. On the night breeze came faintly the
ring of a horse’s hoof on granite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our anxious friends aren’t losin’ any time,” he
said, grinning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re damn whistlin’,” agreed Bud. “Beg
pardon, ma’am. I done forgot you was here. I
meant to say he was doggoned right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the cañon they emerged into a rough country
of basaltic rocks twisted and misshapen. Once
a rabbit scurried from almost under the feet of
Vicky’s horse. The scent of the sage was strong in
her nostrils, and the taste of alkali in her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the girl was happy. This night ride, with her
face against the wind and the eternal stars above,
made the blood in her body sing. She vibrated with
excitement. The rapid motion, the knowledge of the
armed pursuit, the touch of peril in the situation,
appealed to all the adventure zest in her heart.
As they rode knee to knee through the darkness
the movements of the horses occasionally pushed her
and Hugh into contact. A new delightful thrill
flamed through her. Shyly she looked at him and
was glad of the night. Her eyes were too bright
and her cheeks too hot to be seen even by old dog
Tray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old dog Tray! She knew the metaphor was inept.
Jim Budd, now, was a good old dog Tray, but not this
light-stepping young Apollo who somehow contrived
to be the partner of all the dramatic moments in her
life. She would never forget him as he had faced
Sloan and his gang at the mouth of the pit from
which he had come with all the anguish of the night
written on his face. There had been something
indomitable in his gesture, a spark in the sunken eye
struck from the soul of a man quite sure of himself.
Vicky knew—and knew it with a strange reluctant
dread—that her feelings would insist on a retrial of
the case of Hugh McClintock at the bar of her judgment.
Vaguely she divined that the true romance
is not of outward trappings but straight from the
heart of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The miles of their journey stole the hours. It was
far past midnight when Hugh turned to Vicky with
a smile not free from anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bell’s Camp just ahead,” he said. “Don’t make
any mistake. When we’re ordered to halt, all our
hands go straight up in the air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wished now that he had not let the girl come
with them. It had been easy to reason in the light
of day that she would be quite safe. But Dodson
did not know she was in the party. Suppose someone
got excited and fired in the darkness. Hugh’s
imagination began to conjure disaster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the affair worked out quite simply. From
behind rocks on both sides of the road men rose
suddenly and covered the party with rifles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stick ’em up. Reach for the sky,” a voice
ordered curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six hands went up instantly, almost as though they
had been waiting for the cue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may pull yours down, Dutch,” the voice
went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh spoke suavely: “Must be some mistake,
gentlemen. Mr. Dutch isn’t with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not with you! What’s the use of lying? Speak
up, Dutch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re meanin’ me, my name’s Budd—Jim
Budd from Piodie,” spoke up the fat man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The challenger stepped close and stared up at
his face. “Where’s Dutch? What have you done
with him?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, we left him at Piodie. The sheriff didn’t
want us to bring him,” Budd said with bland innocence,
grinning down at his questioner. “Is this
here a hold-up, or what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of ’em’s a girl,” cried another of the armed
men in sharp surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A girl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky spoke now. “Isn’t that Mr. Dodson—Mr.
Ralph Dodson?” she asked quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Lowell! What are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might ask that about you, Mr. Dodson,”
she retorted. “I’m going with Mr. McClintock and
Mr. Budd to Carson. Haven’t you heard that two
ruffians tried to murder Colonel McClintock?”
Her voice rang out like a bell. It accused him,
if not of conspiracy to murder, at least of aiding
and abetting the escape of the murderer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After just an instant’s hesitation Dodson spoke
gravely. “Yes, I’ve heard, Miss Lowell. Believe
me, I have been greatly distressed. If there’s anything
I can do——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can help us bring to justice the desperado
who escaped,” she cried hotly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dodson chose his words with care. He knew they
were likely to be reported by some of his men to the
gang at Piodie. “If someone got into a quarrel with
Colonel McClintock and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They didn’t get into a quarrel with him,” Vicky
flung out indignantly. “They crept up behind him
and shot him down while he wasn’t looking. Even
rattlesnakes give warning. These reptiles didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really don’t know the facts, Miss Lowell.
But if you’re correctly informed certainly——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, if—if—if,” exploded the girl. “Just words.
The attack on Scot was the most dastardly, cowardly
cruel thing I ever heard of. The men who
did it and those who had it done are as bad as red
Indians.” Her eyes stabbed into him. They were
filled with the passionate intolerance of youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can’t talk about that because I don’t
know anything about it,” Dodson said, his surface
smile working. “We’re here under orders from the
sheriff at Piodie. He sent us word that someone
was attempting illegally to abduct Sam Dutch.
There seems to be some mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that it remains for you to apologize for having
drawn guns on us,” Vicky said tartly. “Then we’ll
move on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dodson flushed. “I’m certainly sorry if we
alarmed you, Miss Lowell. Under the circumstances
it couldn’t be helped. If we had known you were
out riding with friends——” He stopped, leaving
his sarcastic sentence suspended in air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much obliged, Mr. Dodson,” she answered
angrily. “I suppose you felt you had to say that
pleasant farewell remark. I wouldn’t be out riding
with friends at this time of night, as you would have
put it if you had the courage, if your friends hadn’t
laid in wait to kill my brother Thursday evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh spoke quietly and evenly. “We’ll say
good-night, Mr. Dodson, that is, if you’re quite
satisfied we’re not concealing Mr. Dutch about our
persons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dodson fell back with a wave of his hand. The
rifles were lowered. In a moment the travellers were
on their way. The mine owner looked after them
with a frown on his brow. He was not satisfied.
He believed he had been tricked, but for the life
of him he could not tell how.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Budd was the first of the three to speak. “You
got us out of that fine, Miss Lowell. Had him busy
explainin’ why-for the whole time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Vicky was not willing to leave the case as it
stood. She was annoyed at herself. Yet her judgment
defended her course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I acted like a vixen,” she said. “But I wanted
to put him on the defence. The easiest way to meet
an attack is to attack first, Scot once told me. So I
tried to ride roughshod over him so that he wouldn’t
dare take us back to Piodie with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He couldn’t fight Miss Victoria Lowell,” Hugh
told her, smiling. “If it hadn’t been for you he
ce’tainly would have taken us to Piodie. But you
had him right. He couldn’t do a thing but let us go.
We’re much obliged to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, out of the darkness, while Budd was
riding a few yards ahead of them, Vicky’s voice came
with unwonted humility:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were right, Hugh, and I was wrong. I
heard something about him the other day. Mrs.
Budd told me, and it came direct. No matter
what it was, but—I don’t want to be friends with him
any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh’s heart lifted, but all he said was, “I’m glad,
Vicky.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch31'>CHAPTER XXXI</h1></div>

<h3>HUGH TAKES THE STUMP</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>hey</span> found Scot still defying the predictions
of the doctors by hanging on to the thread
of life that tied him to this world. He was
asleep when the travellers arrived. Within a few
minutes Hugh was in the saddle again and on the
way to meet Byers and his prisoner. Before morning
they had Dutch behind bars in the Carson jail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Hugh tiptoed in to see Scot a second time,
the wounded man smiled at him reproachfully.
The Colonel’s hand slid weakly along the bedspread
to meet his brother’s brown palm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad you’re back safe,” he said in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We brought Dutch along,” Hugh said by way of
explaining his absence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint flash of amusement lit the drawn face.
“Buck much, did he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he reckoned he wouldn’t come along. Then
he reckoned he would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot asked a question: “What have you been
parboiling your face for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got caught in a mine fire. How are you feelin’,
Scot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine and dandy,” murmured the older brother
indomitably. “Mollie’s spoiling me. Everybody’s
mighty good. When I don’t feel so trifling I’ll say
thank you proper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie kissed him and said gently, “Now, you’ve
talked enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Business, much neglected of late, called Hugh
to Virginia City. Every two or three days he ran
down to Carson for a few hours. The doctors
became more hopeful. The great vitality of their
patient was beginning to triumph over the shock
his system had endured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, Scot’s political campaign had died
down. If the Dodsons had been willing to let it
alone, Ralph would probably have been nominated
without opposition. But this was just what they
could not do. They knew themselves that they had
played a poor part in the contest with the McClintocks,
and they were afraid that Nevada’s private
judgment would be the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sinister whispers passed from mouth to mouth.
They found a discreet echo in the newspapers friendly
to the Dodson candidacy. Scot McClintock had
broken up the home of Robert Dodson. He belonged
to Nevada’s past and not her present. The disgraceful
affair at Carson showed him to be a desperate
man, in the same class as the men Hopkins and
Dutch. This was hinted in veiled language and
not openly charged by the press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at the Maison Borget, as good a French
restaurant as could be found between New York
and San Francisco, that Hugh first learned of these
rumours. He had been too busy to read any newspaper
except a local one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Senator Stewart, seated alone at a small side
table, called to him. The young man took the place
opposite him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s the Colonel?” asked the senator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not out of danger, but we think he’s gaining.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine. Glad to hear it. What about his campaign?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to have dropped by the wayside, Senator.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big man stroked his long yellow beard. “Pity.
I’d like to see him win. With these stories going
around——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What stories?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The senator told him. He ended with a startling
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you take the stump and answer the
lies, Hugh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me? I’m no orator.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None needed. You can talk straight, can’t you?
Call a lie a lie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon. But it’s a game I don’t savvy, Senator.
If I was going gunnin’ for statesmen I’d never snap
a cap at Hugh McClintock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just hit out hard from the shoulder. Talk
right out for Scot as though you were with two or
three friends. Carry the war into the enemy’s
camp. Show how they’ve stacked the cards against
your brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock’s eyes blazed. “I’ll do it, Senator.
I’ll give Scot a run for his white alley yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did. To every camp and town in the state he
fared forth and told the story. He told it at mine
shafts, in saloons, around hotel stoves, and in public
meetings called for that purpose. Much to his
surprise he developed a capacity for public speaking.
His strength lay in the direct, forceful simplicity of
what he said. He was so manifestly a sincere and
honest champion that men accepted at face value
what he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At one town Captain Palmer, who had organized
the Aurora vigilance committee, introduced him in
characteristic fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see the big head on his broad shoulders.
It’s up to you to decide whether there’s anything in
it,” he said bluntly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh plunged straight at his subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m here to speak for a man who lies at Carson
wounded by three bullets from the revolvers of two
murderers. I’m here to answer the whispers set going
by the men who profit most by that attempted
assassination, men who would never have the courage
to say any of these things face to face with Colonel
McClintock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reviewed his brother’s life and tried to interpret
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say he was a gambler. So he was, at a time
when nine tenths of the men in this state gambled
hard and often. But they can’t say he wasn’t a
straight gambler. There never was a crooked hair
in the head of Scot McClintock. Everybody knows
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without gloves he took up the charge that Scot
had broken up Robert Dodson’s home. He showed
that Dodson was a drunken ne’er-do-well who had
smothered his own baby and had afterwards been
rescued from a mob of lynchers by McClintock,
that he was a wife beater and a loafer who by chance
had later stumbled into a fortune, a man always
without honour or principle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was this same man who rode out of Carson at
breakneck speed fifteen minutes after my brother
had been shot down from behind, rode with the
red-handed murderer Sam Dutch. It was this
same man and his brother Ralph Dodson who tried
to keep me and my friends from bringing Dutch
back to Carson as a prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the beginning of this campaign they have
smeared mud on the reputation of Scot. Even now,
when he lies at the point of death at the hands
of their hired killers, they go about hissing poisonous
lies. The record of Scot McClintock is an open
book. You know all his faults. They are exposed
frankly to all men’s eyes. If he was wild, at least
his wildness was never secret. It was a part of his
gay and open-hearted youth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh passed to his later years, to his brilliant
career as a soldier, and to his public services as a
citizen since the close of the war. He named Scot’s
qualifications for the office he sought and concluded
with an appeal for justice in the form of a vindication.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevada was young. It understood men like the
McClintocks and it liked them. Ralph Dodson was
of a type it neither knew nor wanted to know. The
verdict was unmistakable. The political bosses gave
way to the public demand, and Scot McClintock
was nominated on the first ballot by a large majority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh took the Carson stage to carry his brother
the news.</p>

<h3>FATHER MARSTON PROPHESIES</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>ulky,</span> morose, sluggish as a saurian, Dutch lay
in his cell and waited for deliverance. The
weeks passed. The Dodsons sent him word to
say nothing, that when the time came they would set
him free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He suspected them as he suspected everybody.
If they failed him he meant to betray them. But
the time had not come for that yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he grew weary of confinement his restlessness
found vent in a plan of escape. From his boot he
worked the tin piece used as a stiffener for the leg.
With this as a tool and a piece of a broken bed slat
as material he began to shape a wooden pistol. He
worked only when he knew he would be alone. The
shavings that came in thin slivers from the pine
he hid in the mattress upon which he slept. When
the weapon was finished he rubbed it with lamp
black till it took in a measure the colour of steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the man’s temperament to be patient
as an Apache when he found it to his advantage.
He waited for his chance and found it when the jailer
made his round one evening to see that all was
secure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moonlight was shining through the barred
window on the bed in checkered squares of light.
Dutch was pacing up and down his cell when the
guard appeared. He moved forward to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gimme a chew, Hank,” he said ingratiatingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The killer was a sullen and vindictive prisoner.
The jailer had tried to placate him, for now that
Scot McClintock was getting better it would be only
a question of time till Dutch would again be loose on
the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, Sam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The jailer dived into his right hip pocket, found a
plug of tobacco, and handed it through the grating
to his prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch caught the man’s wrist and twisted it
down against the iron bar of the lattice. Simultaneously
a pistol barrel gleamed through the opening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gimme yore six-shooter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now unlock
the door. Let out a squawk an’ I’ll pump lead into
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The jailer obeyed orders. Dutch hustled him
into the cell, then tied and gagged him. He took
the keys, went downstairs, unlocked the outer door,
and walked into the night a free man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood for a moment at the door, hesitating.
Which way should he go? The first thing was to
get a horse at some stable. That would be easy
enough. All he had to do was to go in and ask for it.
But should he go back to Piodie, try Virginia City,
or cut across the Sierras to California and say good-bye
to Nevada?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he had made up his mind which road to
take his thoughts were deflected into another channel.
A young woman passed on the other side of the
street. He recognized her immediately. The light,
resilient step, the gallant poise of the slender body
identified their owner as Victoria Lowell. He was
sure of it even before the moonlight fell full upon
her profile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes lit with a cunning tigerish malice. Softly
he padded down the street after her. There was in
his mind no clear idea of what he meant to do. But
he was a born bully. She was alone. He could
torment her to his heart’s content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved faster, came abreast of her after she
had turned into a dark side street. His step kept
pace with hers. She looked up to see who her companion
was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gasp of surprise broke from her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His grin was a leer, hideous and menacing. “How
are you, m’dear? Didn’t expect to meet up with
old Sam, did you? But tickled—plumb tickled to
death to see him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Involuntarily she quickened her step. His arm
shot out and his great hand closed on her wrist. A
shriek welled up inside her, but she smothered it
unvoiced. The shudder that ran through her body
she could not control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He purred on: “Came to meet old Sam soon as he
got out. Had to see him right away, didn’t you?
Couldn’t wait a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a twist of her forearm she tried to break
away. His rough fingers crushed deeper into her
soft flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You in a hurry, sweetheart?” he went on, and
his heavy body shook with unholy mirth. “Afraid
of old Sam’s winnin’ ways? Don’t like to trust yore
feelin’s with them, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go,” she ordered, and her voice shook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly his mood changed. He thrust his hairy
gorilla-like head close to hers. “When I get good
an’ ready, missie. Think you can boss Sam Dutch,
do you? Think I’ve forgot how you shot me onct
when I took you in outa the storm? Think I care
for yore cry-baby ways? You’ll do jest like I say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going home. Don’t you dare stop me.”
She could not make her quavering voice quite as
confident as she would have liked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Home. So you’re going home?” His slow
thoughts struck another tangent. “Good enough.
I’ll trail along an’ see you get there safe, missie.
Like to say ‘How-d’ye-do’ to Colonel McClintock
whilst I’m there.” His teeth uncovered in a snarl
of rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky’s fears for herself fled, swallowed up in the
horror of a picture struck to life by her imagination.
She saw Scot lying helpless on his bed with this
ruffian gloating over him. A flash of memory carried
her back to another scene. This time it was Hugh
who lay at the ruffian’s mercy—Hugh spent and all
but senseless, his muscles paralyzed by the cold of the
blizzard that raged outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A week before this Scot had been moved from the
hotel to a small private house put at the family’s
disposal by friends who were temporarily in California.
He and Mollie would be alone. She dared
not lead the killer to the house. What ought she to
do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The killer now knew what was the first thing he
meant to do. He would go and finish the job he had
left undone some weeks earlier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Home it is, m’dear. Hot foot it. I got no time
to waste. Where do you live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her thoughts flew. Since he did not know where
the house was she could mark time at least. They
were close to a corner. She turned to the right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way,” she said, and led him away from the
house where Scot was lying in bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shuffled beside her, still holding fast to her
wrist. His presence was repugnant to her. The
touch of his flesh made hers creep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re hurting me. Why don’t you let me go?
I’ll not run away,” she promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you’ll not—if you don’t git a chance,
sweetie.” His fangs showed again in an evil grin.
“If I hurt you some it ain’t a circumstance to the way
you hurt me onct. I ain’t aimin’ to let you play me
no tricks like you done then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came to a house, set a little back from the
road in a young orchard. Victoria opened the gate
and they walked in. Her brain had registered an
inspiration. Straight to the porch she went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch warned her. “Remember. No tricks,
missie. You lead right into the room where he is an’
don’t say a word. Un’erstand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. You’ll promise not to hurt him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My business. I got an account to settle with
both them McClintocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any rate, you won’t hurt anybody else in the
house,” she said faintly. “You’ve got to promise
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suits me. I ain’t intendin’ to run wild.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swear it,” she insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swore it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky, still with his hateful fingers about her
wrist, opened the door and walked into the house.
At her touch a second door swung. Before Dutch
could recover from the surprise of what he saw,
he had moved forward with the girl into a room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man was sitting at a desk writing. He looked
up, astonished at this interruption. The man was
Father Marston.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wants me to take him to Scot,” Vicky said
simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her explanation sufficed. Dutch, a many times
killer, stood before him with a drawn revolver in his
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The minister rose. “So you brought him here
instead. Well done, Vicky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The desperado ripped out a violent oath. “Make
a fool of Sam Dutch, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His fingers moved up to the fleshy part of the girl’s
forearm and tightened. She could not keep back
a cry of pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marston stepped forward. He had served through
the war as a chaplain and the spirit of a soldier was
in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hands off, Dutch!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The teeth of the bad man ground together audibly.
“You sittin’ in, Parson?” he asked in a thick, furious
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Take your hands off her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gaunt gray-eyed preacher faced the killer’s
rage and overmatched it. He had both moral courage
and the physical to back it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Scot McClintock?” demanded Dutch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll take that up when you’ve turned Miss
Lowell loose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God, you’re not runnin’ this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get your hand away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bully felt that he either had to kill this man
or do as he said. He dare not shoot him down.
Father Marston was too well beloved in Nevada.
His was one of those staunch souls which commanded
an immense respect. Back of him now the gunman
felt the whole weight of civilized opinion in the state.
It was a spiritual power too potent to be ignored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fingers loosened from Vicky’s arm and fell
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s McClintock at?” the man with the
revolver asked again hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First tell me this. What are you doing here?
Why aren’t you in prison where you belong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I broke out. Tha’s why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll give you a piece of advice. Get out of
town. Now. Quick as you can hit the road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m askin’ you where McClintock’s at, Parson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the eyes of the two battled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sam Dutch, your name stands in this country
for murder, treachery, drunkenness, and all other
evils known to man. You’re as black-hearted a
villain as ever I knew. If you’ve got one redeeming
trait I don’t know what it is. Now, listen. You’re
going to get out of town now. Right away. You’re
not going to murder Scot McClintock. You’ll
walk with me straight to Doc Benton’s stable. You’ll
arrange with him for a horse. And you’ll drop
into the saddle and light a shuck out of Carson.”
The voice of the preacher rang harsh. It carried
conviction, but Dutch wanted to know what was
back of this edict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who says I’ll do all that?” he sneered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say it. If you don’t I’ll rouse the town and
hang you in front of the jail. That’s a promise made
before God, Dutch. I’ll keep it, so help me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The killer’s mind dodged in and out cunningly
and could find no way of escape. He dared not kill
Marston. He dared not let him go out and rouse
the town against him. Though he was armed and
Marston was without a weapon, it was he who was
defenceless and the preacher who held him covered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bad man threw up his hands. “All right.
You got me, Parson. I’ll light a shuck, but God
help you if I ever get you right. I’ll sure fix you
so you’ll never do me another meanness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The preacher stood before him straight as a
sycamore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My life is in God’s hand, Sam Dutch. You strut
across the stage of life, poor braggart, and think
yourself mighty powerful. You’re no more than
a straw in the wind. His eye is on you, man. You
can’t lift a finger without His permission. And in
His scripture He has said a word about you. ‘Whoso
sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be
shed.’ And again, ‘All they that take the sword
shall perish with the sword.’ That’s His plain
promise, Dutch. I tell you that your hour is close.
It’s at hand. Repent and flee from the wrath to
come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marston had the orator’s gift of impressive speech.
As he faced the killer, hand lifted in a gesture of
prophecy, eyes flashing the fire of his conviction,
Vicky felt a shiver run over her. The preacher
was, so she felt for the moment, a messenger of
destiny pronouncing doom upon a lost soul. In the
light of what so swiftly followed she was to recall
many times his burning and passionate prediction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dutch sneered, to cover the chill that passed
through him. “The bullet ain’t moulded yet that
can kill Sam Dutch,” he bragged.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch33'>CHAPTER XXXIII</h1></div>

<h3>THE BOOMING OF THE FORTY-FIVES</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>t</span> the gate Father Marston stopped. “You
run along home, Vicky,” he said. “I’ll drop
in after a while and see how the Colonel is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl hesitated. “Hadn’t I better go with
you?” she said. It was not necessary for her to
say in words that she was afraid to leave the chaplain
alone with Dutch. All three of them understood
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marston laughed, rather grimly. “No, child.
Mr. Dutch and I understand each other first rate.
We’ll get along fine. See you later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She left them, reluctantly. The men took a side
street that led toward Benton’s stable. Dutch was
anxious to be gone from Carson. The preacher’s
words had filled him with foreboding. He would
not feel easy until the dust of the capital had long
been shaken from his horse’s hoofs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His surly voice took on a whine. It was his way
of attempting to propitiate fate. “I got a bad name,
Parson, an’ so folks don’t feel right to me. Lemme
say that there’s a heap of worse men than Sam Dutch.
I’ve shot men sure enough, but I ain’t ever shot
one that wasn’t better dead. Most folks don’ know
that. They think I go round killin’ to see ’em kick.
Well, I don’t. Live an’ let live would be my motto,
if gunmen would only lemme alone. But you know
yorese’f how it is, Parson. They git to thinkin’
if they can bump off Sam Dutch they’ll be chief.
So they come lookin’ for trouble, an’ I got to accommodate
’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man came down the street walking as though
he loved it. His stride rang out sharp in the still
night. He was singing softly the words of a trail
song:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Last night as I lay on the prairie,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And looked at the stars in the sky,</p>
<p class='line0'>I wondered if ever a cowboy</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Would drift to that sweet by and by.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Roll on, roll on,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Roll on, little dogies, roll——”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Marston’s heart lost a beat. He felt rather than
saw the figure of the man at his side grow tense as
it crouched. Steel flashed in the moonlight. The
preacher struck at a hair-matted wrist as the gun
roared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The singer stopped in his tracks. With incredible
quickness he dragged out a revolver and fired. The
chaplain thrust Dutch from him and stepped back
into the road out of the direct line of fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boom of the forty-fives seemed continuous
while the short sharp flashes stabbed the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man groaned and clutched at his breast. He
sank down, still firing. On his knees, supporting the
weight of his body with the palm of his hand thrust
against the ground, Dutch emptied his revolver,
ferocious as a wounded grizzly. From his throat
there issued a sound that was half a sob and half
a snarl of rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thunder of the guns died. The singer moved
forward, warily, his gaze fastened on the huge
huddled figure slowly sinking lower. One glance
had been enough to tell him that Marston was
not an enemy. Therefore he concentrated his attention
on the centre of danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marston ran to the fallen man and knelt down
beside him. He tore open the coat and vest. A
single look was sufficient. Three bullets had torn
into the great barrel-like trunk of his body. One
had pierced the right lung. A second had struck
just below the heart. The third had raked from
right to left through the stomach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take my boots off,” gasped the desperado.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chaplain knew that Dutch was aware he had
been mortally wounded. This request showed it.
The Western gunman wanted always to be without
his boots on when he died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Marston eased his head while Hugh
McClintock removed the boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gargoyle grin was on the face of the bad man.
He meant to “die game,” after the manner of his
kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sure rang a bull’s eye, Parson, when you
pulled them Bible texts on me. At that, maybe
I’d ’a’ fooled you if you hadn’t spoiled my aim that
first shot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You realize——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—that I got more’n I can carry? Sure do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marston forgot that this man was the worst desperado
Nevada had ever known. He remembered
only that the soul of Sam Dutch, a poor erring human
being, was about to meet its Maker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His mercy endureth for ever. Repent. Repent
and be saved,” he exhorted earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too late, Parson,” Dutch answered feebly.
“I’m a—dyed-in-the-wool sinner—an’ I’m—hittin’
the trail—for hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s never too late. ‘While the light holds out
to burn, the vilest sinner may return.’ That’s you,
Sam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s sure me, but—I don’t reckon—I’ll——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His body stiffened suddenly, then relaxed limply.
He was dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men rose and looked at each other. Hugh
spoke first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to do it, Father. It was Dutch or me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you had to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t give me any choice. Came a-shootin’
before I knew even who he was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw what he was doing just in time to hit his
arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon that saved me. You were that quick.
I can’t thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t thank me, Hugh. Thank God.” He
looked soberly down at the dead man. “There,
but for His grace, lies Hugh McClintock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed Hugh solemnly.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch34'>CHAPTER XXXIV</h1></div>

<h3>THE BALD KNOB STRIKE</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he</span> room with the bullet hole in the swing
door at the Ormsby House had become a
place of pilgrimage. The proprietor of the
hotel and its patrons pointed it out with pride to
strangers and told the story of how Scot McClintock,
left for dead, had come to life by sheer will power
and killed one of the murderers through the door
without even seeing him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Scot’s actions there had always been a quality
which distinguished them from those of other men.
He had the gift of the heroic touch—somehow struck
from men’s imaginations a spark of fire. His gaiety
and spirit, the sunny grace of his bearing, made for
romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The affair at the Ormsby House capped the climax.
It bordered on the Homeric. To be taken at advantage
by the two most redoubtable killers of the
West, to be shot through and through and left for
dead, and to take immediate vengeance on one of
them under almost impossible circumstances was
a combination of dramatic effect so unusual as to
pinnacle even Colonel McClintock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it had remained for Hugh to write the last act
of the drama. He found men looking at him with
a new respect. Even old friends showed a slight
deference. It was not only that he had killed in a
duel the terrible Dutch, though this in itself was a
sufficient exploit. The manner in which justice
had at last found the killer satisfied men’s sense
of fitness. The story was told everywhere, and
with a touch of awe, that Father Marston had
prophesied to Dutch the swift avengement of God.
On the heel of that prediction the lightnings had
flamed from Hugh McClintock’s revolver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Hugh had been the instrument of justice
was felt to be especially meet. He had dragged
back to Carson, from the pit of hell where he had
been buried, the attempted murderer of his brother.
He had struck with such deadly accuracy that any
one of the three bullets flung by him would have
been fatal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without intention on his part, Hugh’s subsequent
conduct increased the respect in which he was held.
He refused to be lionized, declined even to tell the
story of the killing except to the coroner’s jury.
Inevitably there began to rise a legend of the prowess
of the McClintocks which cast a spell over romantic
minds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The immediate result was that Scot was elected
secretary of state by the largest majority in the history
of Nevada. When he was sworn into office the
management of the firm’s business devolved wholly
upon Hugh. The Virginia &amp; Truckee railroad was
partly completed. Within a few years fifty or sixty
trains a day would be twisting to and fro over the
most tortuous bit of track in the United States.
The McClintocks saw the handwriting on the wall
and began to reduce the number of their teams, ore
wagons, and freight outfits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Piodie came a telegram to Hugh. It was
signed by Jim Budd, newly elected sheriff of that
county:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>The Ground Hog is on a rampage. Big strike. Come at once.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh found Piodie buzzing with excitement.
The strike on Bald Knob aroused keen interest because
this was a new field. There had been a good
deal of development work done there, but the Ground
Hog strike was the first worth-while one that had
been made. Prospectors stampeded for the scene
and located every unoccupied inch for miles. The
wiser heads besieged the owners of claims on the
Knob for leases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byers drove Hugh out to Bald Knob, and the two
looked over the Ground Hog together. If the assays
that had been made held good in general, they estimated
that from ten to fifteen thousand dollars’
worth of ore had been raised within the week from
the shaft. Afterwards Hugh visited the claims
held by himself, Scot, and Vicky, to make sure that
the assessment work had been properly done. He
knew that if there was any excuse for it whatever
somebody would jump these claims. He decided
that the best thing to do would be to get leasers on
the properties as soon as possible, for if possession is
not nine points of the law it is at least one or two
points.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to tell you that yore claims would have
been jumped before this,” Sheriff Budd told Hugh
later with a wise nod of his head, “if it hadn’t been
that you McClintocks are such darned go-getters
nobody wanted to take a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about Miss Lowell’s claim?” asked Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she’s done a heap of work on it. I don’t
reckon any one could hardly get away with it, her
bein’ so popular here, too, an’ a lone, defenceless girl
at that. Piodie would be liable to rare up on its
hind laigs an’ say, ‘Hands off!’ But it’s different
with you an’ Scot. Someone with guts is apt to jump
them claims any minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh dropped around to the schoolhouse that
afternoon to walk home with the lone girl who was
popular. He found her administering corporal
punishment vigorously to a red-headed youth who
promised with sobs never to do it again. She was
not at that moment at all popular with red-head
Hugh judged, and she did not look exactly defenceless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At sight of her visitor Miss Lowell went red as a
flame. She did not often use the switch, and when
she did she regarded it as a confession of failure to
handle the case wisely. It was embarrassing to be
caught in the rôle of a stormy Amazon. It seemed
to her that Hugh was always getting glimpses into
the unlovely and vixenish side of her character.
Yet she knew she had whipped the boy only after
forcing herself to do it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve told Tommie time and again he mustn’t
bully the little boys. I’ve talked it all over with
him and argued with him. But he’s a perverse little
imp. To-day he had three small chaps crying.
He practically defied me. When I threatened to
whip him he said he’d like to see me try it. After
that I had to do it.” Vicky sighed, close to tears
herself. “He’s the only child in school I haven’t
got along with. Most of them like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course they do, and so does Tommie,” Hugh
told her confidently. “It’s just his way of making
you pay attention to him. Probably he’s in love
with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he won’t be any more,” the young teacher
said, laughing regretfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, he will. He’ll like you-all the better.
He’ll be glad he’s found his boss. I know Tommie’s
kind. You’ve taken just the right course with him.
Some boys have to be appealed to once vigorously
through the cuticle. Now you’ll have no more
trouble with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you’re right.” Vicky changed the subject.
They were walking home together along a path
that led to the main street of the town. “Isn’t it
splendiferous news about the Ground Hog? I’m
so glad you’ve made a strike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted to speak with you about that. There’s
some danger of our claims being jumped—not the
Ground Hog, but those on which we have been doing
only assessment work. Byers and I looked over
yours. I don’t see how yours can be in any danger.
You’ve done too much developing. But you can
never be sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve paid out nearly three hundred dollars for
wages,” she said quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know. Did you take receipts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t. Ought I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better get ’em. What are your plans?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A dozen people have been around to ask me for
leases. I hardly know what to do. What do you
think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The more men you get working there the better.
You can’t afford to pay wages, so you’d better sign a
lease. I wouldn’t give it to a single person, but
to two or three in partnership. Tie ’em up tight.
Have a good lawyer make the papers out, so that
there isn’t anything left in doubt. Be sure you get
the proper terms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And good leasers,” she suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s important.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you go with me when we’re arranging the
lease?” she asked, a little shyly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked of Scot and his recovery to health, of
Mollie’s joy in her baby, and of young Alexander
Hugh himself, who was developing wonderful intelligence,
if the letters of his mother were worthy of
credence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In front of the Mammoth Saloon they met Ralph
Dodson. He bowed, and Hugh answered his bow
stiffly. Since the attempt on his brother’s life and
the subsequent political campaign, McClintock did
not pretend to anything but contempt for those of
the name of Dodson. He acknowledged the salute
only because he was with Vicky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl flushed angrily. “We’re not friends any
more, but he keeps that smile of his working just
the same,” she told Hugh. “I told him what I
thought of the way they fight. He pretended to be
amused, but he was furious when I asked him not to
speak to me when we met. He’s really more dangerous
than his brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, because he’s far abler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Budd met them at the front door and hustled
Hugh quickly into the house. “I’ve just had a
message from Jim. There’s a warrant out for
your arrest. It’s for killin’ Sam Dutch, I expect.
Who ever heard the like? But Jim’s got to serve
it, he says. So I’m to hide you in the attic.
When he comes he’ll look for you and won’t find
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the use? If they’ve got a warrant out
for me they’ll get me sooner or later. The verdict
of the coroner’s jury was that Dutch came to his
death at the hands of God. It’s some trick. They
can’t make it stick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what Jim says. It’s a trick. Irish Tom
told him there is something in the air. He doesn’t
know just what. But the Dodsons are back of it.
So Jim says for you to lie low and see what happens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Mrs. Budd. We’ll let Jim run this,”
Hugh said. “I’m in the hands of my friends, like the
willin’ candidates for office say they are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Supper’ll be ready in a little. I’ll have Bennie
watch the road so as to give you time to get upstairs
if any one comes. I expect you’re hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m always hungry when Mrs. Budd gives me an
invitation to eat,” he answered, smiling. “She’s the
best cook in Nevada, and a two-bit restaurant doesn’t
draw me a-tall on those glad occasions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the tip of Mrs. Budd’s sharp tongue to
say that the company at her table might have something
to do with that, but since she was manœuvring
to bring about a certain match between two young
people present she refrained from comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh did very well on steak, roast wild duck, potatoes,
home-made bread, honey, and dried-apple pie.
It is probable that he did not enjoy himself less
because a young woman sat opposite him whose
dark eyes flashed soft lights of happiness at him
and whose voice played like sweet music on his
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Budd was urging on him another piece of
pie when Bennie ran in with news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dad’s comin’ down the road with two other
men,” he shouted in a lifted key of youthful excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh retired to the garret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sheriff Budd came wheezing into the house followed
by his deputies. “Seen anything of Hugh
McClintock?” he asked his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where would I see him? I haven’t been out of
the house,” his plump helpmate answered tartly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I got to search the house. Some folks
seem to think he’s here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s he done?” asked Vicky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, he kidnapped that good kind citizen
Sam Dutch, a man who hadn’t murdered but fourteen
or fifteen people, and who never packed more’n two
guns an’ a pig-sticker at one time,” the sheriff said
dryly. “Such lawlessness sure ought to be punished
severe. I’d say send this McClintock fellow to
Congress or somethin’ like that. Make a sure enough
example of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim waddled into the dining room. His eye fell
on the devastation of the supper table. If he
noticed the extra plate at the table he made no
comment upon it. Neither did the deputies. The
sheriff had hand-picked them carefully. Little
Bennie followed, wriggling with excitement. Up to
date this was the big adventure of his young life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim’s eyes asked a question of his wife and received
an answer. He learned from the wireless that had
passed between them that his instructions had been
carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look through the kitchen and the hen house,
boys,” the sheriff gave orders. “Then we’ll move
upstairs. I don’t reckon he could be here without
Mrs. Budd knowin’ it. But the way to make sure is
to look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They presently trooped upstairs. While the
deputies were searching the bedrooms Budd puffed
up to the garret. In order to establish his identity
he sang a solo:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Old dog Tray ever faithful</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Grief cannot drive him away.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;He’s gentle and he’s kind,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And you’ll never, never——”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff opened the door of the attic and
stepped in. Hugh was straddling a chair with his
elbows across the back of it. He grinned at his
friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d talk about being faithful if I was you, Jim,”
he murmured lazily. “Here you’ve deserted that
good old friend Grimes whose coat was so unusual it
buttoned down before and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Budd shut the door hurriedly. “No use tellin’
the boys you’re here. What they don’t know won’t
hurt them none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True enough. What’s up, Jim? Why all this
hide-and-go-seek business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno what’s up, but somethin’s gonna be
pulled off. The Dodsons want you locked up in the
calaboose while the fireworks are on. If they want
you in, we want you out. That’s how I figure it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not oblige ’em and put me in jail? Then
they’ll be easy in their minds an’ start in on their
programme. You can fix it so I escape when I’m
needed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Budd had opinions of his own on that point.
“No, sir, I don’t aim to let any prisoners break outa
my jail if I can help it. While I’m sheriff I’ll be
a sure enough one. Onct you git behind the bars
you’re my prisoner an’ I’m an officer sworn to keep
you there. But now I’m old Jim Budd an’ you’re
Kid McClintock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This seemed to Hugh a distinction without a
difference, but he understood that to Budd it made
the line of cleavage between what was the square
thing and what was not. He did not attempt to
argue with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Have it yore own way, old-timer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff went downstairs and reported to his
men that they would go down and search the corral
stable for the man they wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of us ce’tainly would have seen him if he’d
been in this house,” he concluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the deputies, who was rolling a cigarette,
grinned down at the makings. It chanced that he
had heard voices in the attic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of us sure would,” he agreed affably.
“Me, I ain’t lost McClintock awful bad anyhow.”</p>

<h3>McCLINTOCK READS TENNYSON</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>M</span>iss Lowell,</span> schoolmarm, sat in the parlour
of her boarding house and corrected spelling
papers. Across the lamplit table from her
was Hugh McClintock. He was browsing through a
volume of poems written by the man who had been
for two decades and still was the world’s most popular
philosopher of progress. The book was Vicky’s,
and she handed it to him with a word of youth’s
extravagant praise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he’s the greatest poet that ever lived.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh smiled. “He’ll have to step some.” He
mentioned Shakespeare and others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Vicky flamed with the enthusiasm of a convert.
“It’s not only the music of his words. It’s what he
says. He shakes the dead bones so. If you haven’t
read ‘In Memoriam’ you must.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve read it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever read anything so—so inspiring?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s great. Remember that Flower-in-the-crannied-wall
piece. I don’t recollect how it goes exactly,
but he pulls it out by the roots an’ talks at it.
Says if we knew what it was and how it had come
we’d know what God and man are. I reckon that’s
right. He sure set me thinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love him.” The girl’s face was aglow in the
lamplight. “He’s just wonderful, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult now to understand the tremendous
influence of Tennyson among all the English-speaking
peoples fifty years ago. Before Darwin was accepted
and even before he had published, the Victorian
poet was pointing the way with prophetic vision.
He was the apostle of the new age, of the intellectual
freedom that was to transform the world. His voice
penetrated to the farthest corners of Australia and
America. The eager and noble minds of youth
turned everywhere to him for guidance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To-night, however, Hugh was nibbling at verse
less profound. He was reading “The Gardener’s
Daughter.” A descriptive phrase flashed at him:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A certain miracle of symmetry,</p>
<p class='line0'>A miniature of loveliness, all grace</p>
<p class='line0'>Summed up and closed in little.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Involuntarily his glance swept to the dusky head
on the other side of the table. Her shining-eyed
ardour seemed to him the flowering of all young
delight. Another verse leaped out at him from the
page:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. those eyes</p>
<p class='line0'>Darker than darkest pansies, and that hair</p>
<p class='line0'>More black than ashbuds in the front of March.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He turned the pages abruptly and began “The
Charge of the Light Brigade.” It would never do
for him to get sentimental.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Budd opened the door and pushed her
head into the room. “Mr. Ralph Dodson’s here an’
would like to see you—on business,” she announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To see me?” asked Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Miss Lowell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what about,” murmured that young
woman, putting down the paper she was marking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t care to see him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hadn’t you better?” suggested Hugh. “If he’s
got something up his sleeve we might as well know
what it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. He can come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh rose to go, but she made a little gesture that
asked him to stay. “If you don’t mind,” she said,
smiling at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit. He probably knows I’m here, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dodson bowed to Vicky, more stiffly to McClintock.
The man from Virginia City just acknowledged
his greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ve come to see me about my claim, Mr.
Dodson, you can speak before Mr. McClintock.
He’s my business adviser,” Vicky said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big mine owner was ever so slightly taken
aback. “My business is rather private,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that it is a secret?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. I have an offer to make you. But
first I ought to preface it with a statement of fact,”
he said formally. “Your title to the claim you’ve
been working isn’t good, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why isn’t it?” she asked sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A prior interest in it was held by Singlefoot Bill,
an old prospector who located on Bald Knob and
worked all over it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did no work on my claim to speak of. When
I began my assessment work there wasn’t a hole
two feet deep on the location.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled. “That will be a matter for the courts
to determine, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The courts. What do you mean?” she snapped.
“This old prospector never did any real digging on
my claim. He’s dead, anyhow. Who is there to
make trouble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody will make you trouble, I’m sure, Miss
Lowell,” said Dodson with a suave smile. “My
brother and I will be pleased to sign over the claim to
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sign it over to me? What have <span class='it'>you</span> got to do
with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We own it. We own practically all the Bald
Knob group of mines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh spoke for the first time. “News to me, Mr.
Dodson. When did you get ’em?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost two years ago. We bought out Singlefoot
Bill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who didn’t own ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We think he did. The courts will probably have
to pass on the title.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He never patented them. How could he, when
he had done no work to speak of on them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll prove he did, Mr. McClintock,” purred
Dodson. “He seems to have done all that was
required.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you claim that? He hardly stuck a
pick in any of the claims that are being worked by us
or our friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we’ll be able to furnish evidence to show
that he did,” Dodson answered smoothly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t doubt that,” retorted McClintock.
“You could get witnesses to swear that you are
Napoleon Bonaparte. But it’s too raw. You can’t
put it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dodson smiled a thin-lipped smile. “No need to
discuss that now. Fortunately Nevada has courts
above reproach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s plain robbery,” Victoria said indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Attempted robbery,” amended Hugh. “It won’t
succeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not here to bandy names. What I came to
say is that my brother and I want to do justice, Miss
Lowell. You’ve been spending money on the claim
you thought was yours. We intend to relinquish it
to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t take it,” the girl answered hotly, her
cheeks stained with high colour. “I’ll stand or fall
with my friends. You can’t buy me off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you look at it that way, of course there’s nothing
more to be said,” replied Dodson with dignity.
“I’m sorry. I’ll say good-evening, Miss Lowell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a moment, sir.” Hugh’s voice was like the
sound of steel on steel. “What’s this about a warrant
for my arrest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dodson looked at him, eye to eye. “Well, what
about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I killed Sam Dutch in self-defence. The coroner’s
jury was satisfied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then so am I. I’m told this warrant charges
conspiracy to kidnap and kidnapping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dodson turned contemptuously to the door. At
the same instant it opened and Byers stepped into
the room. His glance travelled from Dodson to
McClintock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve jumped our claims,” he said quietly.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch36'>CHAPTER XXXVI</h1></div>

<h3>SIGNED BY WILLIAM THORNTON</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>hen Byers</span> spoke Dodson looked hurriedly
at his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh was the first to speak. “Who told
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim Flynn. He hustled right down from Bald
Knob.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anybody hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Our boys threw up their hands. Jumpers
had the drop on ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flynn know any of the gunmen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sloan was one,” answered Byers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock turned to Dodson. “Do you pay
yore gun-fighters by the job or by the day?” he asked
contemptuously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t answer questions put that way, McClintock,”
said Dodson stiffly. “Your manner is
an insult, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an insult if these roughs are not being paid by
you. Can you tell me that they’re not?” demanded
Hugh, eyes cold as the steel-gray waters of Lake
Tahoe on a wintry morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you nothing under compulsion, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which means that I’m right. You and yore
brother are back of this outrage. You think you
can get away with our property by wholesale
bribery. I should think you’d know the men you’re
fightin’ better than that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We ask for nothing that’s not ours. We don’t
intend to let ourselves be bulldozed out of anything
that is.” The dark colour flashed into the cheeks
of Dodson. His anger, envenomed by months of
repression, boiled out of him as red-hot lava from a
crater. “I’ll show you McClintocks whether you
run this state. If it takes every cent I’ve got in
the world I’ll ruin you both. To hear and see you a
man would think you were in partnership with God
Almighty. You’ve got folks buffaloed. But not
me—not me!” He slammed his fist down hard on
the table so that the lamp jumped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He whirled and strode from the room in a fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“War, looks like,” said Hugh, turning with a smile
to his friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never knew him to lose his temper before,” said
Vicky. “You spoke pretty straight to him. Do you
think that was wise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? He’s been our enemy for a long time.
Might as well bring him into the open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knew the claims were going to be jumped,
you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but his machine slipped a cog. D’you
see him look at his watch when Dan told us? He
knew what was on the programme, but it took place
earlier in the evenin’ than he had arranged for.
That’s how I figure it out, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are we going to do about it?” asked Vicky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew that the history of the Nevada and California
mining camps was full of tragedies due to disputes
over mining locations. Claim jumping was not
infrequent, and in a good many cases the jumpers
finally won the day. Usually the stronger characters
won, regardless of the justice of the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going to get our claims back,” Hugh replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byers nodded. He was as decided on that point
as his partner. The only question was in what way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sheriff Budd, greatly excited, waddled in; Mrs.
Budd was hard on his heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell’s hinges, boys!” he broke out. “Have you-all
heard what them scalawags have done pulled off?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I been expectin’ it,” Mrs. Budd announced
calmly. She was a woman impossible to surprise.
She made a good wife and mother, but there were
moments when Jim wished she wouldn’t say “I
told you so” quite as often as she did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I hope you’re expectin’ us to re-jump ’em,
Mrs. Budd,” Hugh said with a grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They discussed ways and means. If possible, they
meant to get back their property without bloodshed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If this was Sloan’s play all we’d have to do would
be to throw him out. But there’s brains back of this
move. We’re dealin’ with Ralph Dodson. If we
gain possession we still have the courts to reckon
with. So we’ve got to move carefully and see we
don’t blunder into any mistake,” Hugh said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re shoutin’, Kid,” the sheriff agreed. “It
wouldn’t he’p us a whole lot to go up to the Supreme
Court with two-three killings on the record against
our title.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They slept on their problem and discussed it again
next day. Hugh sent to Virginia City for Scot and
a good lawyer. There were more conferences. Out
of them came one or two decisions. Scot, Hugh,
and their lawyer called at the office of the Katie
Brackett and asked to see Ralph Dodson. He was
out, but his brother Robert was in. At first he refused
to meet them, but his visitors were so insistent
that they would not take no for an answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dodson had them admitted to his office. Sloan
sat beside him. Another gunman was in the room.
From the yellow-gray eyes of the mine owner a furtive
look slid round at the McClintocks and their
lawyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, looky here, Browning,” he said irritably to
the lawyer, “there’s no manner o’ use in you pesterin’
me. See Ralph. He’ll talk turkey with you. I got
nothin’ to do with this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All we want is to see the paper you and Singlefoot
Bill signed up. We’re entitled to see it. You’ve
jumped the Ground Hog and other claims owned by
my group of clients. We’d like to look over your
title. Of course we’re all anxious to avoid trouble.
The only way to do that is to let us know where you
stand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dodson listened sourly. But he was not a fool.
He knew Browning could get a court order to look at
the paper. There was no real objection to it, and
when one is playing an underhanded game it is better
to give an impression of bluff frankness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll gimme yore word not to keep the paper
nor to injure it—you or yore clients either?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. This is business, not highway robbery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dodson shot a slant look of warning at Sloan and
went to the safe. He returned with a sheet of foolscap
paper upon which had been written an agreement
by which William Thornton, known as Singlefoot
Bill, relinquished all rights in certain designated
patented mining claims on Bald Knob to Robert and
Ralph Dodson in consideration of three thousand
dollars now paid him in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Browning copied the paper exactly, word for word,
and comma for comma. Meanwhile, Sloan, his gun
in his hand, watched him and the McClintocks every
second of the time. Both brothers looked the contract
over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lawyer pushed the paper back to Dodson.
“Much obliged. Of course it’s not worth the price
of the ink on it, but you probably won’t be satisfied
of that till the courts have said so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can bet yore boots we make it good,”
retorted Dodson, his dodging eyes jumping to the
men he hated so bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three callers left the office. From the time
they had entered it till the time they left, the McClintocks
had not said a word except in asides to
their lawyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know on how solid a foundation their
case rests,” Browning said as they walked along Turkey
Creek Avenue. “But it never does to underestimate
your opponents. First, we’ll check up and
try to learn if the claims ever were patented. Then
we’ve got to find out all about that contract, the
circumstances under which it was signed, whether
there was any record of it made at Austin. We ought
to be able to discover if old Singlefoot showed any
evidence of having money immediately after it was
signed. Think I’ll go to Austin and make some investigations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, let’s get to the bottom of it,” Scot agreed.
“It looks fishy to me that they’d pay Singlefoot
three thousand for claims not worth a cent then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Especially when he had no valid title and all they
had to do was to relocate them,” added Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not like the Dodson way of doing business,”
admitted Browning. “I don’t know where the
nigger in the woodpile is, but he’s there somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think you’d better go to Austin with Mr.
Browning, Scot,” Hugh said. “You have so many
friends there you might be able to find out something
important.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot dropped a hand on his brother’s shoulder.
“Want to cut me out of the fun here, do you?
Couldn’t think of leaving yet. But I’ll tell you what
I will do. I’ll join Browning at Austin soon as we’ve
taken the next trick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which is——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To get possession of the Ground Hog and the
other claims.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought not to figure in that, Scot,” the
younger brother protested. “You’re a public character
now. You’ve got to look at the future. Politically——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to live with myself a few years, Hugh.
How would I feel if I ducked out and left you to
handle this job? No, I’ll go through. It’s up to
us to use some strategy so as to get our properties
back without killing anybody. That’s what our
brains are for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh did not push his point. He knew when he
was beaten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been millin’ over an idea that might work
out,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t got it quite worked out yet. In an
hour or two maybe I’ll unload it from my mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as Browning had left them he sketched his
plan to Scot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel McClintock’s eyes began to shine. “Ought
to work out fine, if the valley lies as you say. Let’s
go right to it to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-night suits me,” said Hugh. “But we’ll
have to hustle the arrangements.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They spent a busy day.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch37'>CHAPTER XXXVII</h1></div>

<h3>HUGH EXPLAINS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>B</span>ack</span> of Piodie, on the other side of a high
ridge, is a deep valley hemmed in by rock-rimmed
walls. Its area is about ten or fifteen
acres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The McClintocks climbed the ridge and looked
down into the park. It was filled with dead and
down piñon. Two years before a fire had started
there, had raged furiously for a day, and had died
down before the persistent attack of a heavy snowstorm.
Since that time a new growth of underbrush
had come up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scot and Hugh circled the rim, studying carefully
the contour of the slopes. The upper half of these
were rock-ribbed. The timber had climbed up to
these boulder outcroppings and had there given up
the fight to reach the summit, driven back by the
lack of soil in which to root. Down in the basin the
dead trees had crashed and lay across each other in
confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fire never could have got out of the valley
even if the snow hadn’t stopped it,” Scot said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s how it looks to me,” Hugh agreed. “The
only thing that could make it dangerous would be a
high wind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would have to be a gale to spread the fire outside.
The rocks made a break as safe as a fireplace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They covered every inch of the rim to make sure of
this. They did not want to take any chance of setting
fire to the town. Before they left the valley they
were satisfied that a fire inside it could not do any
damage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Budd and Byers, who knew the people of the town
better than the McClintocks did, set about gathering
allies for the night campaign. Piodie was full of
lawless adventurers ready to take a hand in any enterprise
directed against the Dodsons. The difficulty
was not to get enough of them, but to select
the ones with cool heads not likely to be carried away
by excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Vicky was walking home from school she met
Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me everything. What have you done?
Did he let you see the contract? Have you plans
made yet?” In her eagerness the words of her questions
tumbled over each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh told her all he thought it was good for her to
know. He trusted implicitly her discretion, but it
was possible there might be blood shed in the attempt
to win back the claims, and he did not want to make
her a party to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could help,” she sighed. “It’s horrid
sometimes to be a girl. If it wasn’t for my school I
could go to Austin, though, and look up the contract.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you could do that fine. But the fact is I
want to get Scot away from here. Robert Dodson
hates him. I don’t think he’s safe on the streets.
You know how it is with gunmen. Their trigger
fingers itch to kill men with reputations for gameness.
Ever since that affair at the Ormsby House, Scot
has been a shining mark. If Dodson should egg
them on——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked at him with an odd smile. “I suppose
<span class='it'>you’re</span> safe enough here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. They won’t bother me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I suppose not,” she answered with a touch of
sarcasm. “You’re only the man that killed Sam
Dutch, the one that dragged him away from his
friends to jail. Nobody would want to interfere with
anybody as inoffensive as you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t drag him away, Vicky. You did that
when you stopped the rescue at the mine and planned
a way to get him out of town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Both you and Scot are too foolhardy,” she
scolded. “You go along with your heads up and a
scornful ‘Well-here-I-am, shoot-me-down-from-behind-if-you-want-to’
air that there’s no sense in. A
man owes something to his friends and his relatives,
doesn’t he? No need of always wearing a chip on
your shoulder, is there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does Scot carry a chip on his shoulder?” Hugh
asked, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, you know what I mean. He could try
to dodge trouble a little—and so could you. But
you’re both so stiff-necked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon Scot figures that the safest way to duck
danger is to walk right through it,” he said gently.
“There are times when you can’t run away from it.
I always run when I can. Different with Scot.
<span class='it'>You</span> blow him up good. He needs to take better care
of himself, what with Mollie an’ the baby dependent
on him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Yes</span>, you run,” she scoffed. “Were you running
from it when you plastered this town with handbills
about Sam Dutch’s knife? I’ve heard all about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man’s got to throw a bluff sometimes, or get
off the earth and eat dirt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the time you ran him out of Aurora.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hmp! If I’d weakened then he’d ’a’ followed
me an’ made me Number Twelve or Thirteen in his
private graveyard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You make excuses, but there’s something in what
Ralph Dodson says—that you act as though you
had some kind of partnership with Providence that
protected you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you can point out a single time when either
Scot or I went out lookin’ for trouble, Vicky, I’ll
plead guilty to being too high-heeled. All we ask is
to be let alone. When it’s put up to him and forced
on him, a man can’t crawl out of danger. He’s got
to go through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled. “You put me in the wrong, of course.
I know you don’t either of you want trouble. You’ve
used the right word yourself. You McClintocks are
high-heeled. You walk as though you were king of
Prussia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got him backed off the map. I’m an American
citizen,” he answered, meeting her smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though Vicky scolded him, she knew that she
would not want Hugh to carry himself a whit less
debonairly. Her spirit went out in kinship to meet
his courage. She gloried in it that he would not let
himself be daunted by the enmity of men less scrupulous
and clean of action, that he went to meet unsmilingly
whatever fate might have in store for him.
Surely it was only in her beloved West that men like
the McClintocks were bred.</p>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF BALD KNOB</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>fter</span> night had fallen men drifted inconspicuously
to the Pony Express Corral. They
were armed, all of them with revolvers, two
or three with rifles. If any one had studied the
faces of the group that gathered round the lantern
held by Byers, he would have voted these men hard
citizens. Their eyes were steady. They wasted no
words and no gestures. Byers had picked them because,
as he had put it, “they would stand the gaff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without any discussion of the subject Scot naturally
took command of the expedition. He had
learned the habit of it during the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what we’re going to do,” he said
quietly. “The Dodsons have jumped our claims
and put up dummies to hold them. We’ll not stand
for it. We plan to get the claims back by strategy.
Later I’ll tell you how. I suppose Dan has explained
to you where you come in. We’ll give leases on
Bald Knob to those who go through with us. Understand
one thing. We’re not looking for trouble.
I don’t want a single shot fired if we can help it.
We’re not going to kill anybody. It won’t be necessary.
But you boys know Sloan’s gang. They’ll
fight if they get a chance. It’s up to us to see that
they don’t get that chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old-timer who had come round the Horn
spoke up: “Sounds good, Colonel. How do you
aim to get these bully puss men of Dodson’s to give
up without snappin’ a cap at us? You sure got me
guessin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That part of the programme comes a little later,
Buck,” Scot said, smiling at him. “I think we can
pull it off, but I’m not sure. There’s a risk for us.
I don’t deny that. They might get one of us.
We’ve got to take a chance on that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s get this right, Colonel. Do you mean if they
shoot at us we’re not to give ’em what for back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean that if there’s only a wild shot or two
we’re not to fire back. This isn’t a feud. We want
possession of our property. The whole thing will
have to be fought out in the courts later, so we don’t
want to go to law with a black record of any killings
against us. Besides, we’re peaceable citizens who
want our rights. We’re not gun-fighters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” grinned Buck. “You’re runnin’ this
shebang. I never was in a drift just like this before,
but I reckon it’s all right. If I’m the one they get,
Colonel, you’ll have to be chief mourner at the plantin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry, Buck. Our diamond drill’s going
to strike pay ore sure. It’s the Dodson crowd that’s
likely to be in borrasca. Now if you’re all ready
we’ll be travelling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byers led the way up the gulch back of the corral.
Before the party had gone far a young moon came
out and lit the path. They picked their trail
through the sage and greasewood to the head of the
ravine and followed a draw which took into the cow-backed
hills. The pony express rider wound round
to the rear of Bald Knob and climbed a spur upon
which grew a fairly thick grove of pine nut. Here
he stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better camp here, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men unrolled their blankets and prepared a
fireless camp. Soon most of them were sound asleep.
Scot and Byers moved up the shoulder of the hill
to reconnoitre. They knew that guards would be
watching to prevent a surprise, so they took precautions
against being seen. By following a swale
through the brush they were able to come close
enough to see dimly the shaft house of the Ground
Hog and the slaty dump which straggled below like a
thin beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks quiet enough,” Scot whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byers nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hugh won’t begin to paint the sky till after midnight,”
the Colonel went on. “About that time
we’ll bring the men up here into the draw and have
them ready. You’re sure that little fellow Madden
is all right? He won’t betray us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can tie to him,” Byers said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t doubt his good will. What about his
judgment? He looks simple. That’s all right, too,
if he’s not shrewd enough not to make a mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they suspect a thing it’s all up with the plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gotta take a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They lay in the sage for hours, the multitudinous
voices of the night all about them in whispers of the
wind, rustlings of furtive desert dwellers, the stirring
of foliage under the caress of the breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock read midnight on the face of his watch
and murmured to his companion, “Time to get the
men up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byers rose without a word and disappeared in the
darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far away toward the north a faint pink began to
paint the sky. The colour deepened till the whole
sky above Piodie took on a rose-coloured tint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men from the camp below joined Scot. One
whispered to another, “Look at the sky, Ben.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire, looks like. Bet it’s Piodie,” the other said,
startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s not Piodie. It’s the valley back of the
big hill north of town,” McClintock told them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know, Colonel?” asked the first
speaker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because that painted sky is a part of our fireworks,”
he answered. “I’ll explain the programme,
boys. Madden is to run across the shoulder of the
hill toward the Ground Hog. When the guard stops
him he’ll shout, ‘Fire in Piodie; whole town burning
up.’ He’ll explain that Dodson wants them all to
come back to fight fire. My guess is that they’ll
take one look at the sky and start north <span class='it'>muy pronto</span>.
For most of the men guarding the mine own houses in
Piodie. The news will spread down the hill, and all
we’ll have to do is to walk in and take possession.
That is, if we’re lucky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wow! Some strategy, Colonel. Did they learn
you that in the war?” asked the old-timer who had
come round the Horn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid I can’t take credit for it. Another man
made the plan of campaign. It’s up to us to execute
it. Ready, Madden?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Y’betcha, Colonel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock drew him to one side and gave careful
instructions. “They’re likely to ask you a lot of
questions. Take your time to answer them. You’ll
be breathless and panting, because you’ve run all the
way from town to bring the news and to get their
help. If you can’t think of a good answer tell them
you don’t know. You can say the fire was coming
down Turkey Creek Avenue when you left and that
it was spreading to the residence streets. But don’t
know too much. That’s the safest way. You met
Bob Dodson and he asked you to come out for
help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say I met him just as I come out from my
room fastenin’ my suspenders,” contributed Madden,
entering into the spirit of it. “I’ll say I lit a
shuck for Bald Knob an’ only hit the high spots
on the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. Well, good luck to you.” Scot gave him
one more suggestion. “They may leave a man or
two at the Ground Hog. If they do, try to lead them
round to the north side of the shaft house. We’ll
creep up as close as we can and try to surprise them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reaction of Dodson’s mine guards to the news
that Piodie was on fire was exactly what the McClintocks
had anticipated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madden, halted by the sentry, gasped out his message.
In an incredibly short time the men were out
of their bunks listening to it. Not the faintest gleam
of suspicion touched the minds of one of them.
Wasn’t the proof of Madden’s story written red in
the sky for any of them to read? They plunged
back into the bunk house and got into more clothes.
As fast as they were ready the men went straggling
downhill toward town. Much against his will they
had elected a young teamster to stay on guard at the
Ground Hog. Madden volunteered to stay with
him on duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was easy to lead the teamster round to the
north side of the shaft house, from which point they
could better view the angry sky and speculate on the
progress of the flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doggone it, tha’s just my luck to be stuck up
here whilst the rest of the boys go to town an’ see
the fun,” the faithful guard lamented. “I wisht
I’d joined the hook an’ ladder comp’ny when I was
asked, then I’d sure enough have to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madden sympathized. It was tough luck. If he
wasn’t all tired out running from town he certainly
would like to see the fire himself. Sure enough it
was an A-1 fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat down on a pile of timbers that had been
hauled up to the Ground Hog for sets to be used in
underground work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man came round the corner of the shaft house
and moved toward them. The guard caught sight of
him and remembered what he was there for. He
jumped up and pulled out a revolver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep back there!” he ordered excitedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man moved evenly toward him, hands buried
in his trousers pockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guard backed away. “Who are you? Git
back there. Hear me? Git back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a duel of wits the man who is certain of himself
has the advantage of the one who is not sure. Scot
McClintock did not lose a stride. His unhurried indolence
radiated confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want a little talk with you,” he said quietly.
“Thought probably——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Git back or I’ll plug you. Sure will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. No sense in that. Bob Dodson
now——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The teamster had backed to the wall. He did not
know what to do. He could not shoot a man lounging
toward him with his hands in his pockets. Perhaps
Dodson had sent him, anyhow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Dodson——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question died in his throat with a gasp of
consternation. He recognized now this easy-mannered
intruder as the redoubtable Colonel McClintock,
and he was not sufficiently alert-minded to
meet the situation. If the man had come at him
six-shooter in hand, he would have known quickly
enough what to do. But in the fraction of time given
him he hesitated. McClintock was a big man in the
state. The teamster was not sure how far Dodson
would back him. He had been hired by Sloan to
take orders and not to show initiative. Before he
could make up his mind the chance was lost. A
dozen men poured round the corner of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Irritably he barked out a question: “What in
Mexico you-all doin’ here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel McClintock held out his hand smilingly.
“Your six-gun please.” Voice and eyes both carried
an imperative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The teamster clung to his long navy revolver.
“Looky here. I’m in charge here. Dodson won’t
like you fellows hellin’ around the Ground Hog.”
His wandering eye took in the flushed sky, and
found there a momentary inspiration. “Mebbe
you don’t know Piodie is burnin’ up right now.
You-all better light out for town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock did not answer in words. His steady
eyes still held the man with the weapon. His hand
was still extended. Reluctantly, against his own
volition it seemed, the teamster’s arm moved forward.
He was still telling himself he did not intend
to give up the six-shooter when Scot’s fingers closed
on the barrel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two stood a moment, eye to eye. The mine
guard’s hand dropped slowly from the butt of the
weapon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You carry good life insurance, Colonel?” asked
drily the old forty-niner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock divided his command. One third of
the men he left with Byers in charge of the Ground
Hog. The rest he took with him to the other claims
that had been jumped. One of these was deserted.
At another they found the guard asleep. The jumpers
on Scot’s claim surrendered at discretion to
superior numbers. Those who had been left at
Vicky’s fired a few wild shots, but as soon as they
learned that the Ground Hog had been captured they
gave up with the honours of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The battle of Bald Knob had been won by the attackers
with no casualties.</p>

<h3>SLEUTHING</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>cot</span> was called back to Carson on official business,
so that it was Hugh who entrained for
Austin to join Browning on his search for evidence.
In the old days of the pony express the boy
rider had seen Austin a score of times. It was in
the heart of a desert that stretched six hundred
miles from east to west, a desert walled in by the
Rockies on one side and the Sierras on the other.
The town lay huddled between the sides of a cañon
which ran sharply up from the Reese River valley.
Houses were built everywhere and anywhere, on
ground so steep that one side of a house often had a
story more than the other. It was a place of dirty
sprawling shacks surrounded by dry dusty plains
upon which no birds or wild beasts could be seen.
The note of the place was its raw crudeness. For
here, half a thousand miles from San Francisco, the
first wave of Pacific Coast migration had spent itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet even Austin had its social amenities—its
churches, its schools, its first-class French restaurant,
its theatre, and its daily paper. When Samuel
Bowles of Springfield, Massachusetts, passed through
the town in the middle ’sixties he found its barber
shops as well equipped as those of New York and its
baths as luxurious as continental ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over a Chateaubriand with mushrooms, following
a soup that could have been inspired only by a Gallic
brain, Browning and McClintock sat at a small
table in the famous French restaurant and discussed
the problem before them. The lawyer had made
small headway. He knew the date of William
Thornton’s death. The man had fallen down a shaft
while drunk two weeks after the date of the contract
which the Dodsons held. He had found no evidence
of any irregularity. Nobody he had met recalled a
visit made by the Dodsons to town, but in the ebb
and flow of the camp’s busy life they might have been
here. For in the boom days hundreds of men drifted
in and out each week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Browning had worked at the court house. Hugh
mixed with people at the post office and in saloons.
A dozen times that day he turned the conversation
upon Singlefoot Bill. He picked up a good deal of
information about the habits of that eccentric character,
but none of it seemed very much to the point.
The first lead he struck was at the Mammoth Lager
Beer Saloon, a big resort on the corner of Main and
Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old-timer had been telling a story about Thornton.
After he had finished he pulled himself up and
ruminated. “Doggone it, that wasn’t Singlefoot,
either. It was his brother Chug.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was news to Hugh. “Had he a brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure had.” The old-timer chuckled. “Lived
in cabins side by side an’ didn’t speak to each
other for years. I reckon the good Lord never made
two more contrary humans than Chug an’ Singlefoot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Chug now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s been daid two years.” He referred the matter
to another tobacco-stained relic. “When was it
Chug died, Bill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill made a stab at the date. His friend promptly
and indignantly disagreed with him. They argued
the matter with acrimony, but Hugh learned nothing
definite from the quarrel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remembered that newspaper editors are encyclopædias
of information and departed from the
saloon, even though he had read in an advertisement
that “Votaries of Bacchus, Gambrinus, Venus, or
Cupid can spend an evening agreeably at the Mammoth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The editor made Hugh free of his files. He was not
sure about the dates of the two old fellows’ deaths.
One had died about three months before the other,
but he could not even tell which one had passed away
first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were alike as two peas from the same pod,”
he explained. “Both cranky, gnarled, and tough old
birds. Even their names were almost identical.
One was Willis Thornton and the other William
Thornton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh’s eye quickened. He had an intuition that
he was on the edge of an important discovery,
though he could not guess what it was. He looked
through the back files till he came to the issue of
August 14th of two years earlier. A short story on
the back page was the one he wanted. The last
sentence of it sent a pulse of excitement beating
through his blood. The story read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>OBITUARY</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>We regret to record the death of our esteemed fellow citizen
William Thornton, due to an accident which occurred Thursday
night while on his way home after an evening spent down town.
It appears that Mr. Thornton must have strayed from the path
in the darkness of the gulch and fallen down a deserted prospect
hole. His head struck the rocks below and death was probably
instantaneous. His body was discovered there next morning
by Jim Simpkins who works a claim near by.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Thornton was one of the first settlers at Austin and has lived
here ever since. He was an eccentric character and had become
an institution of the town. His brother Willis Thornton, the
well-known prospector called Singlefoot Bill, died last June, it
will be recalled.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh read the last sentence a second and a third
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His brother Willis Thornton, the well-known
prospector called Singlefoot Bill, died last June
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Either the reporter was in error or Hugh had
stumbled on a fact of prime importance, one that
knocked the props out from under the whole Dodson
case. For if Singlefoot Bill was Willis and not
William, and if he had died in June and not in
August, then he could not have relinquished his claim
to the Dodsons on July 29th of the same year. The
claimants must either have bought from “Chug”
Thornton instead of Singlefoot, or else the paper was
a forgery pure and simple. One phrase of the document
stuck in Hugh’s memory. The conveyor of
the property had been referred to as “William
Thornton, known as Singlefoot Bill.” But surely
“Chug” Thornton, before signing so important a
paper, would have corrected an error so flagrant as a
reference to himself as Singlefoot Bill. The fact
that this mistake in identity had been allowed to
stand pointed to forgery. Probably the Dodsons
had learned the date of William Thornton’s death,
had never heard of his brother, and had jumped to
the conclusion, just as Browning and Hugh had done,
that he was the old prospector who had worked
Bald Knob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All of which reasoning was based on the hypothesis
that the story he had just read was true as to facts.
Hugh proceeded to run it down. He looked over the
June files of the paper and found the obit of Willis
Thornton. At least three times in the story he was
referred to as Singlefoot. It even mentioned the fact
that he had prospected for years at Piodie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the newspaper office Hugh went to the
undertaker. That gentleman was drowning his
sorrows at the Mammoth, but he was one of that
class of drinkers whose mind is clear only when he
has had a few drinks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t remember which was Willis and which
William,” he told Hugh, “but I know I buried
Singlefoot in June and Chug in August. Whyn’t
you go out to the graveyard an’ look up the tombstones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s good advice. I’ll take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh wandered through the bleak graveyard
perched on the side of a hill across which the wind
always seemed to sweep. He found the graves of the
brothers, and above each a clapboard upon which had
been lettered their names, cognomens, and the dates
of their deaths. These, too, confirmed what he had
learned from the paper and from the undertaker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Browning found out what Hugh had discovered
he thumped the table in his room with an
excited fist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got ’em right. We’ll spring our surprise
on Dodson, trap him out of his own mouth, and throw
the case out of court before it ever goes to a jury,” he
cried.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch40'>CHAPTER XL</h1></div>

<h3>IN THE MESH OF HIS OWN NET</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>B</span>ut</span> after full discussion, the Bald Knob mine
owners decided to let the case go to the jury.
They wanted to put the Dodsons on record
in order to make stronger a criminal action against
them later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence of the plaintiffs consisted of testimony
to the effect that Singlefoot Bill had worked
the claims, that he had a patent, and that he had sold
the properties to the Dodsons. The contract of sale
itself was offered in evidence. Both Robert and
Ralph Dodson gave supplementary evidence as to
the conditions under which the contract was made.
Their story was clear, concise, and apparently unshaken.
The only fact which had apparently not
been clearly established was that Thornton had ever
patented the claims. The records did not show the
patent, but it was urged that the papers had been
destroyed in the big fire. Oral testimony was introduced
to substantiate this contention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ralph Dodson was the last witness for the plaintiffs.
He was a good witness, quiet, very certain of
his facts, smilingly sure of the issue. Plainly he had
impressed the jury of farmers who were trying the
case. They knew nothing of the history of the
ground in dispute, and were ready to accept what
they heard on its <span class='it'>prima facie</span> merits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In cross-examination Browning asked a brisk and
careless question. “You bought direct from this
prospector Singlefoot Bill, Mr. Dodson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not from any of his heirs or assigns or creditors?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. The contract shows that I bought from
William Thornton, known as Singlefoot Bill, the man
who originally located and worked the claims.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see. The date was——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“July 29th, 1867.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite sure that was the day on which you bought
from this Singlefoot Bill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. The contract shows that.” Dodson spoke
with contemptuous impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I understand it, your title rests on the fact
that you bought from William Thornton, known as
Singlefoot Bill, on July 29th, 1867.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and on the fact that we have since continued
to hold the property without selling it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bought from Singlefoot Bill himself, in person?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I’ve said so already twice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were there when he signed the contract,
Mr. Dodson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he read it before signing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Casually or carefully?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very carefully. I remember how long he was
reading it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think he understood it all—knew exactly
what he was doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Undoubtedly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dodson was surprised. He had expected a savage
gruelling, a fierce attack on every point of his testimony.
Instead of which the opposing lawyer had
asked a few harmless questions and waved him
aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifteen minutes later Ralph Dodson’s face had
faded to an ashen gray. Browning had proved by
competent witnesses, beyond the shadow of a doubt,
that Singlefoot Bill was named Willis Thornton
and not William Thornton, and that he was buried
just six weeks before the date upon which it was
claimed he had signed the contract.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lawyer was now introducing evidence to prove
that Singlefoot Bill had admitted three weeks before
his death, before several witnesses, that he thought
he would drop work on Bald Knob without patenting
any of his prospects. Ralph was not listening to it.
His face was a sneering mask, but inside he was a
cauldron of seething emotion. What a fool he had
been, yet how natural had been his folly. He had
made sure of the date of William Thornton’s death
and had obtained a specimen of his signature. This
William was a prospector. He answered accurately
the description of Singlefoot Bill. Who under
Heaven could have guessed there was another
Thornton to rise up from the dead and confront him
with his guilt?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew the Bald Knob cases were lost. That was
the least of a train of evils he had let loose on himself.
For the first time he had been exposed to the public
gaze as a crook. He had put himself within reach
of the law. If his hired witnesses deserted him he
might even go to the penitentiary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the emotion which predominated in him was
not fear. It was hatred. As the trial progressed he
saw clearly that Hugh McClintock had been the rock
upon which his plans had shipwrecked, just as he had
been the cause that had brought defeat to him when
he ran for office and when he wooed Victoria Lowell.
The fellow was for ever in his way. He blocked his
vision so that he could find no pleasure in life.
With all the bitterness of a vain man whose hopes
and ambitions have been thwarted, he hated the man
who had fought him to a standstill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hatred grew. For after the McClintocks and
their friends had won the Bald Knob cases Ralph
Dodson found his place in Nevada less secure. The
big men at Virginia and Carson, so he chose to think,
at least, were a bit less cordial to him. They could
forgive shady work if it were not exposed, but if it
failed they had no sympathy for it. He had made
many enemies, and now they rallied round the
McClintocks. He and his brother were indicted for
forgery and for conspiracy to defraud by uttering a
forgery. The Katie Brackett was pinching out.
It began to look as though the firm had over-extended
itself financially. His bitterness centred on one
man, the one he chose to think responsible for the
accumulation of trouble that was heaping upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His brother came to him and whispered in his ear.
They were in the office of the Katie Brackett at the
time. The yellow-dotted eyes dodged furtively
about the room. They rested on a map of the Piodie
mines, on a calendar, on the waste-paper basket, on a
broken pane in the window, anywhere but in the eyes
of the man to whom he was mouthing a proposal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For once Ralph did not want to meet his gaze.
He listened sullenly. “I’ll not have a thing to do
with it—not a thing,” he said at last. “It’s too
dangerous. We’ve got too many men already who
can ruin us by talking. Better drop it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not askin’ you to mix up in it. But I’ll tell
you the truth. I’m scairt of that fellow. He’ll
send us to the pen sure as he’s alive. I’ll fix his
clock. You keep out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to hear a word about it. Not a
word. Understand. I’ve forgotten what you told
me. You’d better forget it, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hmp! Mebbe you wantta go to serve time. I
don’t. With that fellow outa the way we’d be all
right. You don’t have to know a thing about it.
I got a way to fix things. Sure have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, don’t come to me about it. I’ll not listen
to a word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert Dodson showed his bad teeth in an evil
grin. He understood that he had been told to go
ahead and play his own hand.</p>

<h3>FROM THE JUNIPERS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>ommie</span> the red-headed stayed after school
to bring in kindling and a supply of piñon
wood for the big drum stove in the centre of
the room. Ever since his teacher had whipped him
he had been her eager and willing slave. His eye
was always alert to anticipate the needs of the slim,
vital young woman he adored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So wholly was his heart hers that Vicky was more
touched than amused. He was a forlorn little orphan,
sometimes underfed, she suspected, and she
mothered him in such ways as she found possible.
Perhaps she favoured him ever so little in the assignment
of school privileges dear to children, such as
letting him pass the water more often than she did
others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got kindlin’ an’ wood ’n everythin’, teacher.
What’ll I do now?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky, working over next day’s lessons at the desk,
smiled her thanks. “That’s all, Tommie. You’re
a great help. Run along home now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must I?” he pleaded. “Can’t I go home when
you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Tommie. I’ve a lot of work to do yet. And
you know you promised to clean up the yard for
Mrs. Fenway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under pretense of seeing whether her pencil
needed sharpening, Tommie sidled up to the desk
close to his teacher. She knew what he wanted. If
she had kissed him his masculine vanity would have
been wounded, but the lonely child in him craved
affection. Her arm slipped round his shoulder and
she gave him a quick hug, scolding him a little at the
same time because his coat was torn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommie grinned and ran out of the building. A
moment later she heard his carefree whoop outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It happened that the boy was at that particular
stage of life when his imagination revelled in make-believes.
It was impossible for him to walk home
sedately along the path. He told himself he was Kit
Carson, and he hunted Indians as he dodged through
the sage toward town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young scout’s heart gave a little jump of fear.
For in the clump of junipers to which his stealthy
steps had brought him two men lay stretched on the
ground. One of them carried a rifle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got it fixed,” the other was saying, almost
in a murmur. “Sent him a note from that li’l tiger
cat the schoolmarm for him to come an’ walk home
with her. He’ll be along sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommie recognized the man as Robert Dodson,
the biggest figure in the camp’s life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll protect me, Dodson? You’ll not go back
on me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure we’ll protect you—me’n Ralph both—to
a finish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you don’t, by God, I’ll peach on you sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sho! It’s plumb safe. You do the job, then
light out. No danger a-tall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. You c’n run along. I’ll git him sure
as he passes along that path,” the man with the
rifle promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you make any mistake. Get him right.
No need to take any chances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never missed at this distance in my life. He’s
my meat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soon as you’re sure of him light out an’ come
down Coyote Gulch. I got an alibi all ready for
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommie, face ashen, his knees buckling under him,
crept back on all fours out of the junipers. As
soon as he had reached the open sage the fear in
him mastered discretion. He ran wildly, his heart
pumping furiously. Fortunately, he was by that
time too far away to attract the attention of the two
men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into the schoolroom he burst and flung himself
on Vicky. One glance at his face told her that he
was very frightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Tommie?” she asked, her arms about
his shaking body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gasped out his news. She went white to the
lips. It seemed to her for a moment that her heart
stopped beating. It must be Hugh McClintock
they were ambushing. She guessed they were luring
him to his death by means of a forged note from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What could she do? She must move quickly and
surely. There were two ways to town from the
schoolhouse, one by the cut, the other over the hill.
The assassin was lying close to the point where
these paths met. She could not watch both and
reach Hugh in time to save him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky did not know where Hugh was nor how to
find him with a warning. Five minutes loss of time
in finding him might be fatal. She thought of Ralph
Dodson. Was he implicated in this? Even so,
she knew he would cry back if he knew the plot
was discovered. He was always at his office at this
time of day, and that office was at this edge of town.
If she could get word to him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, Tommie,” she cried. “You know Mr.
Dodson’s office—Mr. Ralph Dodson. Go to him
quick as you can and tell him to come to me—right
away—at the cave-in where he rescued Johnny.
Tell him he must come at once—that I need him now.
Understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommie nodded. Already she was leaving the
building with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You go by the cut, and if you see Hugh McClintock
tell him what you’ve told me and that he’s
to stay in town, she explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m,” Tommie said. “I’ll ’member.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tell Mr. Dodson anything except that I
want him just as soon as he can get to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No’m, I won’t.” His heart beat fast with
excitement, but he crushed back the fear that
mounted in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They separated. Tommie hurried along through
the cut and Vicky climbed the hill to the summit.
She knew that the man lying in the junipers could
see her. If she had known exactly where he was,
she would have gone straight to him and forced him
to give up his plan by remaining at his side. But
in the thick underbrush she knew there would be
small chance of finding him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the brow of the hill she stopped and swept the
path with her eyes. Nobody was coming toward her
along it from town. Her heart was in a tumult of
alarm. If Hugh came by the cut and Tommie
failed to meet him or to impress him sufficiently
of the danger, he would walk straight into the ambush
prepared for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was torn by conflicting impulses. One was to
hurry down the hill to town with the hope of finding
Hugh before he started. Another was to retrace
her steps toward the junction of paths and wait
for him there. Perhaps if the bushwhacker saw
her there he would not dare to risk a shot. But
she rejected this as a vain hope. He could fire in
perfect security from the brush and slip away in the
gathering dusk without any likelihood of detection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not in her nature to wait in patience while
Hugh might be hurrying into peril. She turned and
walked swiftly back along the path she had just
climbed. The shadow of dusk was falling. Objects
at a distance began to appear shadowy, to take on
indistinctness of outline. The panic in her grew
with the passing minutes. A pulse in her parched
throat beat fast. Sobs born of sheer terror choked
her as she stumbled forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped, close to the tunnel where the little
boy had been entombed. With all her senses keyed
she listened. No sound came to her tortured brain,
but waves of ether seemed to roll across the flat
and beat upon her ears. She waited, horrible endless
minutes of agonized distress. In a small voice
she cried out to the man in the chaparral that she
was watching him, that if he fired she would be a
witness against him. But her hoarse voice scarce
carried a dozen yards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From out of the junipers a rifle cracked. She
ran down the path blindly, in an agony of fright.
Before she had taken three steps the rifle sounded
again. A scream filled the dusk, a scream of fear
and pain and protest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lurching figure of a man moved out of the
gloom toward the running girl. It stumbled and
went down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a sob of woe Vicky flung herself down upon
the prostrate body. “Hugh!” she cried, and the
word carried all her love, fears, dreads, and terrors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sound came from the still form her arms embraced.</p>

<h3>HUGH RIDES TO AN APPOINTMENT</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>B</span>ald Knob</span> hummed with activities. The
Ground Hog was taking out quantities of rich
ore. On Vicky’s claim the leasers had struck
a vein which might or might not develop into a paying
proposition. A dozen other shafts were going
down and from the side of the hill a tunnel was
progressing at a right angle toward the Ground Hog
drift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fame of the new discovery had spread over
the state and from all directions prospectors were
stampeding to the diggings. A steady stream of
wagons wound up and down the hill. They brought
to the camp flour, bacon, whisky, coal oil, dynamite,
canned goods, clothing, lumber, chickens, honey,
hay, and the thousand other staples needed by the
young camp. Stores at Piodie set up branch establishments
in tents and flimsy shacks. Other
merchants came in from Eureka and Virginia.
Freight outfits moved bag and baggage to Bald
Knob, wagons loaded to the side boards with supplies.
Gamblers and women of loose reputation
joined the rush, keen to help reap the harvest always
ripe in a young live mining camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most important and the busiest man in the
new camp was Hugh McClintock. He was a third
owner of the Ground Hog and he had claims of his
own in addition. He managed the teaming and
contracting business of himself and his brother,
now with temporary headquarters at Budd &amp; Byers
corral. Moreover, he was looked on as unofficial
father of the camp. To him came drifters out of
work, men who proposed the incorporation of a town
in the saddle of the dromedary-backed hill, solicitors
for contributions to an emergency hospital, and scores
of others who had troubles or difficulties they wanted
to unload.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the afternoon of a sunny day came to him also
a barefoot Negro boy with a note. The note read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Are you awf’lly busy, Hugh? I want to see you. Meet me
at the schoolhouse at five-thirty to-day. Be sure and come.
It is very important.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>Vicky Lowell.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>If Vicky said it was important for him to meet
her, he knew she was not overstressing it. That
young woman was impulsive and sometimes imperious,
but it was not in her character to call a
busy man from his work without a valid reason. It
was her custom to stay at the schoolhouse and prepare
the lessons for next day so that she might have
the evenings free to read or to go out with friends.
Twice he had gone out to the schoolhouse and walked
home with her in order to talk over some difficulty
that had arisen in regard to the leasing of her claim.
But he had gone of his own volition and not at her
request.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were moments during the afternoon, while
he was talking over business matters with the people
who poured into his office, when his pulses quickened
delightfully, when he was aware of an undertug
of excitement coursing through his blood. Was it
possible that Vicky sent for him because—because
she cared for him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rejected this, too, as out of character, as a kind
of treason to her. She was proud and held her self-respect
in high esteem. Even if she cared for him
she would let him travel the whole road to her. Her
lover must come out into the open and ask for all
he hoped to gain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There had been hours of late when Hugh’s heart
had been lifted with hope, hours when their spirits
had met in the mountain tops and they had rejoiced
in the exploration of each other’s minds. The
mentality of girls was a <span class='it'>terra incognita</span> to him. He
had lived among men from his youth. Never before
had he met a soul so radiant, so quick with life, so
noble in texture, as hers, he told himself. The
glamour of her personality coloured all his thoughts
of her. The lift of her throat as she would turn the
beautifully poised little head, the dark flash of her
eyes so mobile in expression, the soft glow of colour
in her clear complexion, even the intellectual quality
of her immature thinking, went to his head like
strong wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in love, with all the clean strength of his
nature—and he rejoiced in his love and let it flood
his life. It permeated all his actions and thoughts,
quickened his vitality. Because he had gone so far
in life sufficient to himself the experience was wonderful
and amazing to him. His imagination halted
at the threshold of his house of dreams. He dared
not let it take free rein. He would tell himself
humbly that this golden girl was not for him, and
next moment he was planning how he might see her
soon and what he would say to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was detained a few moments by a business
detail that had to be settled with a foreman, and after
that a committee of citizens met in his office to decide
about the organization of a fire department for the
camp. He was on edge to be gone, but he could not
very well walk out from a meeting he himself had
called. When at last he got away he knew that he
was nearly fifteen minutes late for his appointment
with Vicky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knowing that he would be rushed for time, he had
ordered a saddle horse to be in waiting outside the
office. He cantered down the road, pretending not
to hear the shout of an old prospector who wanted to
discuss a lease with him. To-morrow would do
well enough for Tim Murphy, anyhow. The important
business of his life just now was to get to
Miss Vicky Lowell as soon as his horse could cover
the intervening miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He travelled fast. It was only a few minutes
later when he rode down Turkey Creek Avenue at a
gallop. He did not stop the horse in town, but
passed through it to the suburb at the farther edge
of which the school had been built.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carelessly, without any special interest, he saw
a man entering the cut two hundred yards in front
of him. He glanced at his watch. The time was
5:49. He would be more than twenty minutes late
for his appointment with Vicky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh rode into the cut. Halfway through it he
pulled up his horse abruptly. The crack of a rifle
had stopped him automatically. He swung from
the saddle and eased the revolver in its scabbard.
The sound of another shot echoed in the cut. A
scream shrilled through the dusk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tied the horse to a sapling with a slip knot and
stepped forward. He guessed that murder had been
done. The shriek that still rang in his brain had
come from a man in mortal agony. Warily as
a panther he moved, for he knew the murderer
had a rifle, and against a rifle at a hundred yards
a forty-five is as effective as a popgun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh edged round the corner of the bend beyond
the cut. Instantly caution vanished. In the gathering
gloom a woman was flying down the road
toward him. She flung herself down to gather up
in her arms a figure lying sprawled across the path.
McClintock broke into a run. Even in the growing
darkness he had recognized that light and lissom
form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vicky!” he cried as he reached her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A face bloodless to the lips looked up pitifully
at him. In the eyes he read amazement, incredulity,
doubt. Then, quite without warning, the girl quietly
toppled over in a dead faint.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch43'>CHAPTER XLIII</h1></div>

<h3>THE SACRIFICE</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>V</span>icky</span> floated back to consciousness and a
world that for a moment did not relate itself
to her previous experience. Hugh McClintock’s
arms were round her, his anxious face looking
into hers. The touch of the night wind was in the
air, and apparently she was lying on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where am I?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You fainted,” he explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” she said vaguely. Then her eyes fell upon
the still body stretched beside her. Her memory
picked up lost threads again and she shuddered.
“I—I thought—it was you.” She clung to him,
her arms round him, as though she had not yet fully
escaped from the horror that had held her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought it was me?” he said, and there was not
such a thing as grammar in the world just then.
“Why should you think that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They meant to—to—kill you. One of my little
boys heard them.” She began to sob softly into his
coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh’s arms tightened about her. His body
glowed with a soft warm happiness. He had never
known Vicky before unstrung and helpless. It was
golden luck for him that he should be the man to
whom she clung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could they know I’d be here?” he asked
gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you get a note? Bob Dodson wrote it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A decoy, to bring me here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. They pretended it was from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She disengaged herself from his arms. The instinct
of sex defence against even the favoured lover
was reasserting itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh tried to put the bits of the puzzle together.
His eyes fell upon the dead body at his feet. “Then—this
man—they must have shot him in place of
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” her dry throat gasped out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McClintock stooped to feel the heart. It did not
beat. He turned the body for a look at the face.
Then, “God!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The face that stared up at him with sightless eyes
was the face of Ralph Dodson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vicky wailed in distress. “Oh, Hugh! I did it.
I killed him! I brought him here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught her hands together in a gesture of
despair. “I sent Tommie for him—told him to come.
I wanted him to save you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh looked down at the face of the man who had
hated him so bitterly. His face muscles twitched.
He was greatly touched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He died in my place—to save me,” he said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I didn’t tell him what I wanted him for—only
that I wanted him right away. And he came—and——”
She broke down utterly. Innocently
she had been the cause of the death of a man who
loved her. Without thought she had lured him into
the ambush his own brother had prepared for his
enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The arms that went round her were those of Old
Dog Tray and not those of her lover. Hugh comforted
her as best he could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not to blame—not in the least. The
men who contrived my murder are guilty of his death.
You called on him for help. That’s all. He had
lots of sand. Even if he had known what would
happen to him he would have come to you. That’s
the way game men are. They go through. If he
were here and could speak to you he wouldn’t blame
you—not a bit of it. He’d say it was just the luck
of the day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but—but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice went on, cheerful, even, matter of fact.
The very sound of it banished despair. Her sobs
diminished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led her to his horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—what’ll we do with—him?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll arrange that when I get to town,” he told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh made a foot rest of his hand and Vicky
climbed to the saddle. He walked along the path
beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once his hand went up comfortingly to find and
press hers in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She whispered, in a small voice she could not make
quite steady, “You’re so good to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not answer. What could he say, except
that if it would help her he would cheerfully let
red Indians torture him? And that somehow did
not seem an appropriate reply.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch44'>CHAPTER XLIV</h1></div>

<h3>UNDER THE STARS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>R</span>obert Dodson,</span> appalled at the horrible
thing he had done, fled with his accomplice
during the night. They reached Reno,
were hidden on the outskirts of the town by a friend,
and crossed the Sierras furtively to California. Here
the trail was lost. Nobody was very anxious to
find it, for Dodson carried with him his own punishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Years later a man from Virginia City met in a
San Francisco dive a drunken wreck who reminded
him of the fugitive. He called him by name, but
the man shrank from him, slid to the door, and
disappeared into the night. This was the last time
Dodson was ever recognized. A rumour floated to
Nevada that he died of yellow fever soon after this
in Mexico, but no proof of this was ever given out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dodson fortune collapsed with the death
of Ralph. The firm had over-extended its operations
and a tight money market closed it out. If Ralph
had lived he might have been able to weather the
storm, but without his guiding hand the Dodson
properties became liabilities instead of assets. A
sheriff’s sale of the mines paid creditors almost in full.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The death of Ralph was the nine-days talk of the
town. From the evidence of red-headed Tommie it
was clear that he had directly or indirectly approved
of the plan to make away with Hugh McClintock.
Most Christians felt it to be a judgment of Providence
that he had stepped into the trap prepared for
his enemy. The pagans of the community voted it a
neat piece of luck for Hugh and buried Dodson
complacently and without regrets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh had been summoned by business out of town
the morning after the tragedy and did not return
for nearly a week. He called on Vicky the evening
of the same day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both of them were ill at ease and self-conscious.
Vicky felt that she ought to be mistress of the
situation, but she could not get out of her mind the
memory of how she had clung to this man and sobbed
in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conventional parlour, with its plush album,
its shell ornaments, and its enlarged photographs
of Jim Budd and his wife, stifled all Hugh’s natural
impulses. He had never learned how to make small
talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew! It’s hot here. Let’s take a walk,”
he blurted out at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to borrow a book from Mrs. Sinclair.
We might walk up there,” Vicky said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Vicky moved up Turkey Creek Avenue beside
this strong and self-contained man she marvelled
at herself for ever having thought him the Old Dog
Tray type. The lights from the saloons and gambling
houses flashed on a face that had stirred her
imagination. He never posed or played to the
gallery. He never boasted. He never made the
heroic gesture. Yet she knew him for one among
ten thousand, first among all the men she had met.
He was clean and simple and direct, yet it had come
about that he held in his keeping the romance of
her life. He was the prince in shining armour she
had dreamed about from her childhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked up the street toward the suburbs of
the town. As they passed the Sacramento Storage
Warehouse the girl, eager to keep up a desultory
conversation, nodded at the alley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Budd told me that was where the man Dutch
shot at you one night,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. He waited for me as I passed. Missed
three shots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shuddered. Even now she did not like to
think of the dangers through which he had come to
her in safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All past,” he said cheerfully. “Strange, when
you come to think of it. All our enemies, Scot’s
and mine, dead or driven out. Yet from first to
last all we ever did was to defend ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came to the end of the road, as he had done
on that other night to which she had referred. They
looked up into the stars and the clean wonder of the
night took hold of them. The blatant crudeness
of Piodie, its mad scramble for gold and for the
pleasures of the senses, faded for this hour at least
from their lives. The world had vanished and left
them alone—one man and one woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When at last he spoke it was quite simply and
without any introduction to what was in his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s never been any woman but you in my
life. Even when you were a li’l trick and I bought
that first doll for you—even then I was getting ready
to love you and didn’t know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got that doll yet. It’s the <span class='it'>dearest</span> doll,”
she said softly, the adjective flashing out as words
were wont to do in her childhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled. “And the black doll—have you that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have that, too. I just loved the boy that
sent it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you love the man he’s grown into, Vicky?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” She said it bravely, without any pretense
of doubt. She was proud of her love. The truth
was too fine to cloud with any feminine sinuosities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew a deep long breath of joy. His dreams
had come true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the stars as witnesses they plighted troth
to each other.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
